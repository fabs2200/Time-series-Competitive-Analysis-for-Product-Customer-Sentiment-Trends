0,Humira,"My Crohn's Story: Recklessness, Denial &amp; Silver Lining?","26F. First time posting on here after years of being a silent reader. I want to share my story with this god awful disease because (1) I'd love to hear about any similar experiences, and (2) I desperately need to find community. I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, and there will be missing pieces, but alas:

**Diagnosis**: My journey with CD started in 2016 (17 yro) with a series of flare symptoms that, at the time, no one could piece together. *Daily vomiting, diarrhea, deep stomach pain, fevers, join pain and swelling, and inability to eat due to burning pains (later discovered via endoscopy, was caused by esophageal ulcers)*. I went to countless doctors who had no idea what was wrong with me. I'm from Brazil, where my family including my mom live, so my last hope was finding a diagnosis there – and I did! 8-9 months after my symptoms began I was finally diagnosed with Crohn's. By this point I had lost \~15lbs, had ulcers all throughout my esophagus &amp; colon, ulcers all over my skin, ulcers on my gums, hemorrhoids so bad that I could no longer sit, and joints so swollen that I could no longer walk without being held up. The GI who diagnosed me in Brazil said it was a miracle that I took my flight back home with my colon still intact – her plan was resection at first assessment.

**Initial Treatment**: Mesalamine orally (don't remember dose) + Prednisone to stop the flare. My GI was extremely hesitant to clear me to return to the US once we got the flare under control as it was a new diagnosis, but because I was getting ready to start my first semester of college, she sent me off under the condition that I'd immediately seek a GI in the US to begin Remicade infusions. And so I did, and that was the beginning of it all.

**Perianal Fistula:** A few months after starting my Remicade treatment (infusions every 8 weeks) I noticed an abscess in my perianal area. I wasn't yet completely informed on CD at the time and decided to take myself to the ER for evaluation. To no real surprise, no one at the hospital connected this abscess to potentially Fistulizing CD, so we did an incision + drainage + packing, and off I went back to my dorm. *This becomes the root of my hell, which I'll get to.* This incision never fully ""healed"" and mildly drained constantly – something that bothered me, but as a dumb college student, I ""put off for another day."" About a year and a half later (2019), the abscess returns and off we go to the ER for another incision + drainage.

**Remicade Termination:** Covid hits, I move back to my hometown to finish my last year of college online. Issues with insurance authorization of my Remicade become recurrent, and long story short – I get off Remicade in 2020 and completely stop treatment of CD. *Yeah, bad move, I know.*

**A ""Dormant"" 3 years:** Surprisingly, I had a relatively smooth ride for the next 3-ish years, while being off treatment completely. The occasional ""mini-flares"" occured, but with everything going on in my life at the time, I started getting into the habit of just dealing with it. I start to question whether I was misdiagnosed. *""How can I have CD, not be on a biologic, and be this okay?""* Well, I wasn't really. That abscess from 2017? It's been actively draining for 6 years (we're in 2023 now) – I've gotten into the routine of poking a sterilized needle into the scar tissue a few times a week to relieve pressure and drain any puss, wear panty liners daily, and just kind of... live with it. The only other notable, recurring symptom was Anemia due to severe daily rectal bleeding. In October of 2023 I end up being rushed to the ER, hemoglobin 6.8, to get a blood transfusion.

**Seton Placement:** The abscess comes back for the third time in 2024, aggressively, I'm no longer able to drain it myself and the risk of sepsis becomes a concern. At this point, I was already aware that this was a fistula related to my CD and a more permanent solution would be needed, but for the sake of getting things under control fast, we do a third (and final) drainage. This time though, they had to go in with a 16G needle to do an aspiration drainage – *traumatizing experience* *btw.* At this point in my life I was finally settled in a city after years of moving around, I finally had good health insurance after years of coverage/copay issues, so I promised myself I'd finally seek help to restart my treatment for CD in 2025.

**TLDR; Humira &amp; Where I am Today:** I'm now being treated at Cleveland Clinic, they've been great. I had a draining seton placed for my fistula in August of this year (4 months, today). We've decided to re-start treatment on Humira this time, as the risk of allergy to Remicade is too high now. This week I started taking Metronidazole (500mg 3x day) + Ciprofloxacin (500mg 1x day), which I will be taking for the course of 2 months. Pending authorization from United HC, I'll begin my Humira injections (160 first dose, 80 second dose, 40 third dose and then ongoing bi-weekly) alongside Methotrexate for one year. Folic acid through all of this as well. *I've read all about the side effects of all of these medications, I know, don't freak me out more, please.*

**My Feelings Summarized:** Today, I feel hopeful, but I'm also terrified. I'm aware that I've been reckless with this disease (re: stopping treatment, putting things off, DIY solutions, etc.), but I give myself grace because anyone with CD knows how frustrating it all is. I've thrown my hands up in defeat more times than I can count, but I want to do things right now. I'm fearful because, ironically, I've been dealing with all of this in my own ways for almost a decade but now I'm facing it head on. It's been awful, but it's been manageable and it's been the reality I learned to accept and adapt to. The fistula sucked, but I got used to poking it, draining it, and dealing with it. The anemia was god awful but I figured out a way to keep it under control. The stomach issues – frankly I don't even remember a life without them. With that said, I'm fearful because I've somehow convinced myself that I've learned how to ""keep this disease under control"" in my own ways, and now with the introduction of all of these drugs, I'm irrationally (or maybe rationally) afraid that it'll ""wake the beast"" again.

I can't help but think: ""D*ealing with all of that, off-treatment, has been annoying for the last 7 years, yeah, but I found a way to make it work. What if all of these medications wake something up and I actually start feeling the* ***real*** *CD again. What if I flare up like I did when I was diagnosed? What if I actually don't even have CD and I'm just taking immunosuppressants and antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs for no reason?*"" – and now that I typed that, yes, I see how ridiculous it sounds.

Anyways, if you read all of that, thank you. There are a ton of gaps and missing pieces of the story – mostly because this would be far too long, and partly because I'm too tired to type more right now. 5 colonoscopies, 3 endoscopies, countless MRIs, 6 GIs across 4 cities, 4 insurance plan changes... the list goes on. There are reasons as to why I was reckless about it all, but that's for another post. If you saw yourself in anything I wrote, please do share, and if you have any advice for this next phase of my CD journey, please let me know.",2025-12-04 04:34:41,CrohnsDisease,5,1pdqr63,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1pdqr63/my_crohns_story_recklessness_denial_silver_lining/,2025-12-04
1,Humira,Biologic Failure(s),"In the past several years, I have failed 4 biologic medications: cymzia, humira, Stelara, and Skyrizi. It appears that I’m now failing remicaid after barely a year! Prometheus test showed zero medication level. I typically have been responsive to these medications for about 1.5 to 2 years when things start to go south. 

Can anyone else share their experiences and hopefully to evidence based resources that can help me understand why this happens? 

Needless to say we are very frustrated. My gastroenterologist has been very supportive. But our current medical environment (US) means that we have semi annual visits and use MyChart for most of our follow up communication. 

Help. I do not want to go back in the hospital right now. ",2025-12-03 14:08:55,CrohnsDisease,18,1pd5502,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1pd5502/biologic_failures/,2025-12-03
2,Humira,Dangers of getting tattooed?,"Hi all, I would like to get more tattoos (got a few before my diagnosis), but I’m a bit scared to get a new one considering I’m on Humira and can’t really afford to get an infection. 

I asked my doctor, she said there’s probably some literature about it but she doesn’t k ow it by heart. So now I’m asking for your experiences! ",2025-12-03 08:58:28,CrohnsDisease,1,1pczaoa,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1pczaoa/dangers_of_getting_tattooed/,2025-12-03
3,Humira,Anyone with proctitis continuously gaslit by GI Dr because labs and scans are good ?,"Diagnosed with Crohn’s colitis for 11 years now.
Been on humira injections for 3 years and had my last colonoscopy 2.5 years ago which showed scribed inflammation in my ascending colon, descending colon, sigmoid (chronic) and rectum. 
Been having 6+ BM a day for 8 years but now it’s escalated to 12+ times with secret disabling symptoms. 

Had been under treated and gaslit by my old GI doctor for so long telling me I was in remission and it’s just IBS. Finally switched doctors and they did new tests all to be gaslit again because the tests showed no active inflammation. 
Waiting on a colonoscopy currently but after 3 weeks of begging they finally prescribed a steroid..  prednisone 🥲. As hesitant as I was I was so desperate and 3 days in and my symptoms have decreased dramatically!!!!!
Further proves inflammation was in fact a factor.. 

I’m learning that apparently proctitis and rectal inflammation that’s localized to that area can be nearly impossible to detect with these usual tests they do.. CRP, calprotectin, MRI, CT enterography…  but instead of acknowledging the faults of the scans ability they just gaslit me that a flare is unlikely … 

Anyone else experience this with distal Crohn’s/ colitis ?

4,Humira,Switching from Humira to Hyrimoz - what was your experience?,"Due to some upcoming changes in my insurance coverage, Humira is no longer going to be covered as of January 1, 2026. I've been on Humira since 2019 and it has done very well for me. I would describe my Crohn's as being about 90% in remission. The Humira has taken care of all of the debilitating symptoms and I only have what I would describe as some occasional residual nuisance symptoms, but nothing that impacts my day to day life.

As a result of the insurance situation, my GI is switching me to Hyrimoz. Both medications have the same active ingredient at the same strength, though I am not sure if there are any minute differences between them. My GI said she only had one patient so far who had a negative experience with Hyrimoz and that was due to an allergic reaction to one of the secondary ingredients.

Has anyone here been switched to Hyrimoz? If so, was the transition smooth? Were there any issues that you experienced with Hyrimoz that you didn't have with Humira?

5,Humira,Crohns and the bright side of life,"I sometimes read this reddit to see how other people live their lives with Crohns or what their experience is and how they're handling it.

  
However, I do sometimes have a dislike for this reddit as it sometimes scares me what all could go wrong and how bad it is.

I have Crohns since I'm 16 (turning 38 in 1 week) and I've had my share of ups and downs but all in all it still seems quite ok compared to some of the horror stories I'm reading here.

  
There should sometimes also be positive notes and things you can accomplish with Crohn's.

I had a serious flare about a year ago. Had a colonoscopy a year ago and that showed 2 new places where Crohn's was active so the hospital asked if I would join a study, had to transfer from Humira to Skyrizi, follow a special 'OATS's diet, etc.. 

Yesterday, a year later, I had another colonscopy and 1 spot out 2 the Crohn's is gone, my dossage for Skyrizi needs to be increased to every 4 weeks instead of 8 but that's it.

But more importantly, the day before yesterday (the day before the colonscopy) I did the physical tests for becoming a firefighter and I passed these tests. So it's not always bad news. You can achieve these things. Sure, I went running (I even did a running contest), swimming or exercising when I should have rested because I wasn't feeling 100% but it's do-able!

I do believe that exercising can greatly help you deal with Crohn's even though it sometimes feels you shouldn't and just crawl in a corner.

But never let this disease drag you down.",2025-11-27 16:15:29,CrohnsDisease,101,1p864cs,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1p864cs/crohns_and_the_bright_side_of_life/,2025-11-27
6,Humira,Skyrizi &amp; Humira Combination Therapy,"Dr prescribed these together. Remicade, which worked really well for small intestine Crohn’s disease, caused large painful abscess like lumps on back of neck and head. Stopped that and went to just Skyrizi. Stool study shows inflammation is very high. Adding Humira hoping this combo keeps the lumps away but also controls the Crohn’s.

Anyone else have experience with this combo therapy? ",2025-11-17 03:58:17,CrohnsDisease,1,1oz6dsr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oz6dsr/skyrizi_humira_combination_therapy/,2025-11-17
7,Humira,If there’s an award for most BM in one day I think I won it,"18 times yall 18 times. 

I realize that I’ve been under treated for years and my old G.I. doctor was very negligent. Always insisted that my symptoms were from IBS not my Crohn’s because my labs were good, but apparently CRP is not a great way to measure Inflammation in a large portion of us.
I finally got into seeing a new doctor because I’ve been suffering for years and just learned to manage and now I absolutely cannot manage anymore.

I didn’t know I had Crohn’s colitis or what that even meant or that I have active Crohn’s in my sigmoid , descending colon and rectum, which have caused me to be going 6+ times a day for 8 years now. 
Well now it’s actually escalated into a full severe flare which I didn’t even know these were symptoms of I thought I had a stricture maybe but nope apparently this is what a flare in this region looks like. It’s the most disabling area. 

Been going 12-18 times a day  awful incomplete evacuation, lately can’t leave my house can barely function at all. This is torture. On top of that I’m autistic and because of my sensory processing disorder, the discomfort is making me have so many meltdowns, and I was too terrified to go to the ER this week. I’m a bodybuilder and have increased joint and back pains which is a sign my meds are failing. 
Finally waiting on CT scan results and hopefully switch from humira to possibly skyrizi.

9,Humira,Perianal Disease/Vaginal Birth/Rinvoq,"Curious. I'm not pregnant or trying. But I did see MFM to talk about options in the future. I have a h/o perianal abscesses and complex fistulas. I have had 4 rounds of sepsis and emergency surgery. They basically said that I'm going to have to have a c-section if I ever give birth. They don't want me to blow out my butthole 😒 I just really don't want to believe that's my only option.

Also they want to take me off Skyrizi and put me on rinvoq. I've failed remicade, humira, and stelara. I am on birth control for now for PCOS. I'm just not ready to close doors yet. I want to leave natural birth and biological children on the table. I may go a different route when I'm ready. It's just crushing that this disease takes so many ""typical"" experience away from us. 

Any of you have a successful vaginal birth with perianal disease? Should I try to avoid rinvoq now or should I just plan to switch when I'm ready to try?

Edit: I don't have any surface level issues. My abscesses have been so deep they have to use IR to even get there. So it's not like I have fissures or cysts that you can see on the surface. And I'm pretty moderate to severe. I haven't been able to achieve remission in the 11 years since diagnosis. I'm planning this with the expectation that remission isn't in the cards for me. I'll wait as long as I can and then I might just try anyway.

10,Humira,Tremfya,"Diagnosed in June of this year after suffering for two years. I dropped 72lbs in nine months to start and was having severe abdominal pain and other not so pleasant symptoms. The doctor said I was a mystery after testing me for any and everything. The last was my stool sample and it showed high calprotectin levels which got me a referral to the GI…Finally. Took 4 months of procedures and tests, but I was officially diagnosed with small bowel crohn’s. Started on budesonide and then started Humira. Humira was a nightmare. Gave me extreme fatigue, migraines, and joint pain. Not to mention I’ve gotten 4 infections since. After I finish off this round of antibiotics, I will be starting on Tremfya.

11,Humira,"Does anyone's stomach sometimes feel very ""hard""?","Male, 30's. Had Chrons for over 10 years. Currently on Humira and not experiencing a flare up.

Hello! I am lucky that Chrons does not cause me any serious problems in my regular life. 

However, about once a year, my stomach walls will feel very hard and I absolutely can not pass gas. During this time, I will feel nauseous as well. This goes away by itself after literally one day. However when I have this I feel very miserable. But since this is rare, lasts for a short amount of time and goes away by itself, I tend to brush it off.

I have tried to look into what this is and if its Chrons related. Sometimes I think its a minor bowel obstruction caused by food and it goes away by itself. 

Does anyone else experience this?

15,Humira,Medication options - getting worried,"I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s since 2014. I had a good run with Humira for almost 7 years before developing antibodies. Since then it’s been rough. I tried inflectra (allergic) and entyvio (didn’t work) before trying Cimzia which worked great. I changed jobs and had to change insurance and my new insurance doesn’t cover Cimzia. So I was on Skyrizi for about a year and a half. Skyrizi gave me horrible joint pain that made it hard to walk and just generally tanked my quality of life. So here I am, another med change. Dr prescribed Rinvoq. I am super concerned about the possible side effects. I’m 42 and struggle with cholesterol and triglycerides and the possible cardiac effects feel too risky. So here’s my long winded point; has anyone tried stelara after trying Skyrizi? Did you experience joint pain? My doc said stelara is a similar drug so he didn’t even want to try it but I cannot accept the side effects of Rinvoq without trying it first.

16,Humira,Being put on two biologics for different symptoms?,"Context: I have had severe joint issues on top of my ibd symptoms. This led to my diagnosis with crohns. Started humira about a year ago, most joint issues improved almost immediately but the rest of my symptoms have not improved much.

Just had a colonoscopy, my doc said the inflammation is as bad as it was a year ago. He believes humira only has been helping my joints. He wants me to try tremfya on top of humira.

I know crohns can affect the joints but it almost appears like humira could be helping something like RA instead of partially helping my crohns symptoms. I’ve seen a rheumatologist at the same hospital and she just said she’ll ""monitor the situation"". I’m wondering if that’s due to the fact that i’m 21, not sure as only a physical exam was done.

Is it possible to have RA if Humira is only helping joint related symptoms? Have you experienced anything like this?

PSA: Of course, I know none of y’all are doctors, just wondering on peoples input/experience. I plan to talk to my gastroenterologist about this but I didn’t post colonoscopy as I was a little out of it.

17,Humira,Living with Crohn’s + fistula for 5 years — has anyone else experienced this?,"Hi everyone,
I’ve had Crohn’s and a fistula with a seton for about 5 years, and I feel like it’s really taking over my life. I also work in healthcare, and I’ve noticed that sometimes other patients have more practical insights than even the professionals — so I wanted to ask for some advice/experiences here.

My Crohn’s symptoms:
	•	Frequent trips to the bathroom (6–10 times a day, often urgent)
	•	so much Gas, occasional pain, and fatigue
	•	I’ve tried several medications (budesonide, Humira, infliximab, Rinvoq, Stelara) and just started Skyrizi — so far the main change is less blood, but I know it takes time to work.

The fistula is what impacts me most. Sitting for long periods can be painful, and there’s ongoing drainage that makes daily life harder. It affects what I can wear and how active I can be. I use protective pads at home , then incontinent underwear at work and when I’m out, but it still feels very limiting.

My team says surgery isn’t an option since it involves the sphincter, and that it may heal if I reach remission. Still, I find it exhausting living like this day-to-day.

I just want to know if people have had similar experiences and if this is just how it goes. I know my symptoms aren’t as bad as they used to be be and there’s definitely other people worse off but I’m just so sick of having to go through this. No one truly understands what you’re going through and half the time there’s no point even explaining to people around me. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I know many of you are dealing with your own challenges, but I’d really appreciate hearing how others cope.

18,Humira,Feel so stuck,"Hi guys, I’ve had crohns and a personal fistula with seton suture for the last 5 years. I feel like I’m just not getting anywhere and it’s taking over my life. I work in the healthcare field too and I’ve realised that more time patients have a better understanding sometimes more than healthcare professionals so I thought I’d post and see if anyone has any advice/suggestions. I’ll try keep it concise 

Crohns :
My symptoms are pooping like 6-10 times a day , most of the time it’s very liquid ,soooo much gas and sometimes stomach pain, fatigue .
I’ve been on budesonide, humira, infliximab ,, rinvoq , Stelara  and have just had my first infusion for skyrizi. Only difference I’ve noticed with skyrizi is I’ve had less frequent blood loss when I poop but I get that it takes time to work so hoping this treatment works. 

However because I’ve dealt with these same symptoms and worse for the last 5 years it’s not even my biggest hassle, it’s more so the fistula. I the seton wound is on my but check, anytime I sit directly on my cheeks (more time I sit with most of my weight on my other cheek )for longer than 10 minutes it hurts when I get up. If I’ve pooped a lot that day, the whole cheek is hot and painful (I figured it’s the fistula tract causing the pain) . It’s constantly draining from the wound site. 

. I lay in bed most of the time cos it’s just easier. I have been complaining bout this to my team but surgery for the fistula isn’t an option as it goes through my sphincter muscle and they said the fistula may heal when Im in remission. But I’m sick of not being able to wear nice underwear or even having to be selective with everything I wear. If I’m at home or wearing something that won’t really show if I leak through I’ll just use gauze in my underwear. But for work and if I’m out all day I wear incontinent pants - the disposable ones.

19,Humira,Making sense of blood test - Adalimumab and Antibodies,"MyChart!!! I love it but damn… you get these results quick but no explanation! My level of Adalimumbab is 0.7 ug/ml and the antibody level is 981, which is very high (it states 301 or greater is high). Anyone else experience this?
Background: diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in August 2024 after a month of suffering and a hospitalization in June. Been taking Humira/Adalimumbab since September 2024. Most recent scope indicated Ulcerative Colitis and ulcers, prescribed Omeprazole and have been feeling pretty good until recently (been living it up and having some foods I shouldn’t because I felt good). Currently having flares off and on for a few weeks. This disease sucks, but I’m managing. Anyone have any experience with these blood tests and what they mean? (Hoping to get a call from my doctor soon for an explanation, just looking for something to make sense in the meantime)

20,Humira,Skyrizi - profuse diarrhea,"Hi everyone. I had my first induction dose infusion this past Tuesday. I had two days of muscle pain/cramping and it was followed by 48h of the most debilitating diarrhea I ever had. I had over 50 episodes of watery diarrhea that eventually transitioned in clear bile stools. I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s for 25 years and I’ve done numerous biologics (Humira, Remicade, Cimzia) and never experienced something like that. 
I went to the ER to get fluids, blood + panel showed no sign of viral or bacterial infection, cdiff negative. They were really puzzled on what happened. 
No one around me is sick, I didn’t have any other signs of a stomach bug; no nausea, no vomiting, no fever or aches, etc. Nothing. 
I refused a CT scan (limiting radiation) since I had a clear colonoscopy 3 weeks ago and a MRE in July that looked good. 
The oncall GI didn’t seem convinced at all that Skyrizi could do that but I’m looking for real life experience. 
Anyone?",2025-09-29 00:55:43,CrohnsDisease,2,1nt4qqg,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nt4qqg/skyrizi_profuse_diarrhea/,2025-09-29
21,Humira,Backpacking with Crohns?,"Hello,

I do not have Crohn's or an IBD, but one of my close friends does. I love backpacking, and would love to take her, but I wanted to ask, first, is this a terrible idea? And second, does anyone have any tips or considerations that I, as someone who does not have an IBD, wouldn't think of? 

She is 20, and she's on Humira. We would plan the trip around her injections so she doesn't have to do that in the wilderness. I think we would work up to an actual overnight, by practicing with backpacks so she knows what to expect. I do have an (expired) WEMT certification so I am somewhat useful in emergency medical situations if anything arises. She said her condition is on the milder end/is well controlled with meds, so no big complications, aside from flares. I would plan a route that is close to roads so we can bail if necessary. One of the things I'm most worried about is energy levels and caloric expenditure. I know she has chronic fatigue, and would have to build up the stamina to go backpacking, but is this something that is a reasonable expectation? Additionally, does anyone have tips on getting more calories in during times of high caloric expenditure? 

She talked to her doctor about it a while ago, who gave the ok, so we do have medical approval lol. 

I mostly am looking for personal experience, because there are lots of things I don't know about Crohn's that I wouldn't know to look out for or consider, and I'm posting this with her permission. 

Thanks so much! ",2025-09-28 19:45:45,CrohnsDisease,0,1nsxo7b,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nsxo7b/backpacking_with_crohns/,2025-09-28
22,Humira,Curious if I went off Humira,Question for yall - I got diagnosed with Crohn’s about a year ago. I’ve been on humira since January &amp; thankfully it’s been working great. So great that I hardly ever think about or worried about flair ups/upset stomach. Almost feels like I don’t have Crohn’s. If I went off this medicine would those symptoms come back?? Has anyone had experience with going off meds? Like I know I have Crohn’s but there’s a tiny part of my brain that thinks I don’t just because the medication seems to be working well!

23,Humira,Flare or failed biologic?,"This is a general question because I have been diagnosed for only 3 years and have now failed both skyrizi and humira. In both cases, I thought the meds were working but I felt like they just stopped being as effective over time after the induction. Since we have the ability to measure antibody levels with humira, about 6 months after the first induction I was feeling like something wasn’t right so we tested levels and I was at borderline efficacious levels without antibodies. This prompted another induction and 40mg weekly. I was feeling GREAT for about a month but I mowed my lawn and the physical exertion totally messed me up and the scope two weeks ago showed severe active inflammation. Similar things happened with skyrizi, about 8 months after the induction I felt kinda okay but not great until I had a very stressful life event and then it went seriously down hill. So my question is, how do you guys know if it’s just a flare that could be treated with extra steroids but still continue with your same biologic? Or do you always change therapies when things get bad enough? So far I think I’ve gotten close to remission but never was able to maintain it due to life circumstances so I’d like to hear your experiences. Next we are going to try rinvoq but may in the future try tremfya or remicade if the humira pk blood tests come back low or with antibodies.",2025-09-26 14:17:46,CrohnsDisease,2,1nr2k61,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nr2k61/flare_or_failed_biologic/,2025-09-26

I asked to not be put on cosentyx, because I read about the risk of worsening IBD. I think that I have Crohns and that the HS might be an extraintestinal manifestation of it, but I likely won't be able to get a colonoscopy for a few months. I'm not asking for medical advice. Has anyone started a biologic for something else while waiting for an IBD diagnosis? What was your experience? Any other thoughts to share?

27,Humira,Should I go with biological?,"It’s back and I need to make the decision. I was first diagnosed in 2012 when I had a severe case of sudden perforation of the ilium, naturally going hand in hand with peritonitis, sepsis, and all the bells and whistles. I spent a week in the ICU, a week in the surgical ward, and 2 weeks in the gastro. It was a hell of a ride, but I made it. 

Was on and off the meds through the last 13 years, but I was blessed enough to be able to live my life to the fullest. I had a decent career in music, switching to tech next. I’ve started a family, switched places, and even countries. I wasn’t bound to the toilet, although I had my fair share of running around searching for it in the weirdest places in the world. I was always treated by a combo of azathioprine and Pentasa, and life was fine. 

Last Monday, I was hospitalised because of severe pain in the abdomen. I decided not to play around and wait, as I remembered the “last” time I had pain like this. I was treated, checked up, and they say the inflammation is back. I will have to go through some other tests, and they strongly suggest we start the biological treatment. They say Pentasa has proven to be ineffective, and since Humira has a bunch of affordable alternatives now, it doesn’t make sense to try Pentasa. Now, as this is a new country to me, I don’t know if this is the case of them just following their most recent protocols or if it’s (tinfoil hat on) the case of big Pharma pushing these through. Any thoughts on that? Now, I know that everyone’s experience is different, and Crohn’s can go very differently for all people, but are people still treating it with Mesalazine?

28,Humira,Need an opinion on Upadacitinib (Rinvoq),"I am 25 year old male from India.
A similar of Rinvoq just launched in India. I was about to go with Remicade after failing humirq but GI suggested Upadoz ( Rinvoq) in last moment. It just launched that day in India..
 He is very excited and suggested it is a better option for me because I've already failed a biologic named humira.

I was little sceptical but went with doctors opinion but the side effects are causing concern. I've started taking the new medication 15days back. Till now I haven't felt any small side effects like acne or headaches etc.., but is it safe to feel relaxed now... when will the sideeffects starts to manifest. The blood clotting and cancer thing are really concerning me...

Are there anyone who used Rinvoq long term, what is your experience ? Did it help you to get into remission ? Are there any preventive measures to stop side effects to effect my body...

I have an impending fistula which made my large intestine bend and touching the small intestine.

I am in crucial point of my career... it is make or break for me. Please help me to understand this medication.

30,Humira,My personal resection surgery story,"Updated 9/4/25 - Day 3, Day 4 and go home! 


Hey everyone, long time lurker as I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s for over 10 years now, but I created a throwaway as I am posting my experience on my social media. 

I just had a laparoscopic ileocolectomy performed to remove part of my small and large intestine. Health wise up until this point, I’ve been dealing with a stricture, two partial bowel obstructions, bowel perforation, and abscess as a result of the perforation. The main goal of this was to remove the diseased part of my intestines, but also explore all other parts and remove any that were diseased. I was in so much pain that I was house bound for a month and my wife, who had just given birth, had to do more things for the family and house since i physically couldn’t.

Day before the procedure, I follow the prep instructions with Miralax and honestly, it wasn’t bad at all. My problem was I was in the bathroom from 4pm to 5am still pooping when my arrival time was scheduled for 615am. I had zero sleep prior to the surgery. 

When I arrived at the hospital, I was supposed to get 4 nerve blocker injections into my abdomen (I was hoping to take the advice of others and get an epidural), but that occurred after they put me under anesthesia. I think it had to do with surgery timing, but I’m not sure and who would complain about being asleep to get shots?

I wake up from the surgery and I do not have a catheter, but I was told they placed one in while I was under anesthesia. My pain felt pretty much eliminated, it was night and day difference between what I had been experiencing and what it was like to not have such diseased parts in your body. My surgeon stated he removed 10-15 inches of intestines. Luckily, I also did not wake up to an ileostomy, but I was mentally prepared because of how bad my crohns had been to me and the life it had stolen from me. 

I have an IV hooked up to a pump to use every 10 mins to manage pain (hydromorphine AKA dilaudid). Like everyone’s advice here, stay up on being ahead of the pain management. Although I felt like I had zero pain from the surgery, I kept taking the pain medications and it helped tremendously as you definitely feel an onset of pain as the nerve blockers wear off. I had 4 incisions and they are relatively small, 3 are about 1/2 inch and 1 is about an inch above my belly button. 

I wait a couple hours and immediately walk around the floor to get the body and guts moving. I had zero issues with walking, the only thing I noticed was that some incisions felt a little tight, but that is from the glue sealing it. 

I end up getting a significant urge to urinate, but I’m not able to. Long story short after 9 hours of no help from the nurse/patient care assistant, I get a straight catheter inserted. Everyone made it sound like it is 100/10 pain, but either because of my pain tolerance or the pain meds you’re on, it was more like a 6/10 pain. The catheter gets removed later, but I had to get a full catheter inserted because after we did a bladder scan/urinate/bladder scan, I wasn’t completely emptying my bladder. This full catheter was more like an 8/10 pain because I already had 2 catheters inserted so there is already irritation and blood inside. 

I was put on a liquid diet for a meal, then put on a low residue diet. On the low residue diet, I overate  because i was starving and the quantity of Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes was too much. I vomit (it was mostly water with an orange tint because of the jello) and get put back on a liquid diet AFTER I had received my dinner which consisted of pizza and Mac n cheese. I knew I had to self-regulate because I just threw up, so I had half a pizza and the jello. I walked around the floor doing two laps and then I ran into my nurse who said I was being put back on the liquid diet. I then told her about my self-regulation and to everyone who asked about the vomit session. I did not throw up after the pizza, so it wasn’t a medical procedure issue, it was clearly me eating too much.

I have had two bowel movements, both looked like dust in the bowl. It is very hard to grasp the feeling if you need to poop because it’s different now. I didn’t have the urge to immediately run to the toilet, it felt easy and natural. This feeling changed for me by day 3! 

Day 3, I must have had 10 bowel movements on Wednesday and wiping absolutely hurt. The burning sensation, constant wiping, some leakage, and looking into the bowel had started to emotionally take a toll on me. However, I knew that I couldn’t just give up that fast, I mean… literally how could I get my intestines back? lol. So I finished the marathon of pooping and pulled my self together by taking a few laps around the floor and thought about the future I wanted. Cheesy, but it helped because you will probably hit a low point, and I wasn’t expecting it to be honest. 

Day 4, at 0005 in the morning, my nurse is ready to pull out the full catheter (he first deflated the balloon, which I didn’t feel anything) and looked at me and said “just count to 3”… I said “oh f*ck you”.. and I counted to 3. Him pulling it out was probably a 4/10 pain. Again, not sure if it was because I had 10mg oxy at 8pm, a high pain tolerance, or it really isn’t that bad. I am directed to pee by 0800 in the morning. I have the urge to pee but I forget to bring/use the little urinal, so i take pictures of me peeing lol. That doesn’t satisfy, so I eventually pee in the urinals and they are happy! Long story short, I’m allowed to leave around 4pm after peeing, bowel movements, gas, walking, and eating!

I would 100% go through this surgery without hesitation even if I had complications. I can tell this is significantly going to improve my life. I still have to figure out with my doctors on what medication I will be on after because I was on ENTYVIO (which I required surgery, so technically failed it), Remicade/humira/and one other medicine which I had failed. 

Valuable information learned or added to the post - First, I believe you should plan 4-5 days in the hospital for this type of surgery. Second, on day 3 for me (including surgery day) i’ve had 10 bowel movements as of right now and mentally i struggled and had some regrets, stay strong! NOTE: this amount is normal. 
Third, you will be taken off of dilaudid and moved to oxycodone (or maybe a different medicine). While in the hospital, I’m allowed 5 or 10mg every 4 hours. 

Please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes due to writing while on dilaudid and oxy. 

Please ask any questions that you may have! I will continue to update this as I recover at home. I realized while being in recovery on the hospital floor, the mental aspect pulls at you hard. When I walked the floor, I would say hi to all the nurses and ENCOURAGE people walking as well. Stay strong and be there for each other going through surgery, it will mean a lot to them and to you.

33,Humira,A Wee Vent- Overwhelmed but Grateful,"I (28f) just got diagnosed with Crohn’s 2 weeks ago after being ill since May. I’ve lost an estimated 15kg since then and been unable to go to work. 

I’ve been hospitalised 3 times since the beginning of August which led to my diagnosis. I have a severe case with inflammation in 3 different places but especially on the right hand side - could not for the life of me tell you the medical names of where exactly! 

It’s fair to say any dignity I had left has been yeeted out the building with all the random objects and appendages appraising my back end passage over the last few weeks. Having 5 different sets of eyes watching you and your arsehole exposed makes you really reflect on life….

Been put on a high dose of prednisone long term and just had my second dose of Humira. 

Can I just say the steroid shakes and sweats are fricken mental?! Spilt soup all over myself (ended up looking like I was lactating with the mess) because my hand decided to go ‘get tae fuck’ with my spoon! Whoops! 

Unfortunately I’ve ended up having a reaction to the biologic (rash/hives, fever, diarrhoea) so that is now off the table! New meds here we come! 

In the midst of all this my partner and I broke up due to the stress of the diagnosis and I am also currently being assessed for ADHD and Autism (both highly likely from screening assessments). 

So life has certainly given me a right good PUNT! 

Howeveeerrr, I will say I’m incredibly grateful for the NHS and while it has been frustrating at times (different doctors, conflicting advice) I’d be truly fucked without it. The nurses deserve a damn good pay rise with the crap they deal with on the daily! 

So yes this disease fricken sucks assssssssss, but I believe had this been even ten years ago my outcome could have been vastly worse. 

My support network has really been amazing to the point I could cry over how thankful I am. I recognise some do not have this so I will NEVER take this for granted.

I believe in the face of adversity/challenges (as a childhood trauma survivor with CPTSD) it is so important to not repress how bad something makes us feel but also to recognise what we can be grateful for. It’s helped me with so much and I hope all of you who are struggling are able to come out the other side. You are not alone, others can empathise and be there 💕

Does it help? Also I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good probiotic for a teen boy with Crohn’s that catches everything?
We are in the process of getting him another test and then treatment will be decided. So far he has just been on pills. He is very,very scared of needles after a bad experience at a lab when he was about 8 or 9 where two ladies held him down to get 9 tubes of blood and he couldn’t breathe (was having an asthma attack). Ever since then it has been a bad experience for him causing him much anxiety. And as you know being on this journey there have been many blood tests and IV’s. He missed so much school last year and has started out rather slow this year with about 85% absences. I just don’t know what treatment to choose if the Dr gives us the choice of the Remicade with the IV’s or the Humira with the auto injections. We do however have to drive 2 hrs one way to get the Remicade IV’s done. My grandson is so frightened of needles that I worry about him jumping or pushing when I’m trying to give the  Humira injections.

36,Humira,Humira vs. Remicade - for the under 18's,"Hi all-

My 12-year-old child was recently diagnosed with moderate Crohns, and many of you weighed in offering helpful framing on the disease and treatment paths.  We have narrowed down to Humira vs Remicade, and will have to make a decision in the next couple of weeks.  Initially, we thought Remicade would be the better path, with only 6 infusions a year, etc, but upon reflection,  we realized that the inflexibility with half day infusions could actually disrupt quite a bit--missing up to 4 days days of school annually, possibly being pulled out of sleepaway camp, limiting family getaways, etc... Not to mention, the discomfort of placing the IV, sitting there for hours, etc.  Whereas Humira with it's fast injections, (current iterations pretty much painless, as we understand it), seems both less ""scary"", (as she wouldn't have to place an IV,) and also, far more ""portable""- something that could come with her to sleepaway camp, on family getaways, and done afterschool or on a weekend.  (Which would, after the first few injections, only take a few minutes rather than half a day.)

What I don't know, is the true efficacy on Remicade vs. Humira- sounds like they are comparable, though Remicade may have a leg up here on fistulas, (though she has none.). It also may have a higher initial response rate.

So-- my question is for people newly diagnosed with Crohns (who have had access to both biologics when diagnosed), and/or especially parents with littles newly diagnosed, or teens, early 20's in a similar situation-- what has been your experience with Humira (or conversely, with Remicade)?  

I now fully understand making a switch from one to the other wouldn't be ideal, (and that at some point in the near future, Remicade may also be an injectable).  But we are faced with the decision now-- start her on Humira, or start her on Remicade?  Open to fully thought through perspectives, especially first hand.

37,Humira,Crohn’s still flaring after every treatment — has anyone found hope after failing so many meds?,"Hey everyone,
I’m really struggling and could use some advice or even just to hear from people who’ve been through something similar.

I’ve had Crohn’s for years and have been through what feels like the full list of meds:
	•	Azathioprine
	•	Adalimumab (Humira)
	•	Infliximab (Remicade)
	•	Prednisone (gave me horrific acne and skin reactions, I can’t tolerate it)
	•	Stelara
	•	Upadacitinib (Rinvoq)
	•	Currently on Risankizumab (Skyrizi) — about 18 weeks in

Despite all this, I’m still in a really bad flare:
	•	Lots of blood
	•	Running to the bathroom up to 10x/day, never feel “finished”
	•	Severe stomach pain
	•	Bone and joint pain, headaches, and sore eyes
	•	Feeling absolutely drained

The skin reaction I had on steroids was awful (my face broke out in painful pustules), so I’m not going back on them.

I’m scared and exhausted. My GI team just keeps cycling me through meds, and it feels like nothing is working. Has anyone else failed this many treatments and found relief, whether through newer meds, surgery, clinical trials, or something else?

Any advice or experiences would mean the world right now.

Thanks 💙

He had to switch to Stelara after 8-9 years on Humira, and we’ve had 4 miscarriages since then.

41,Humira,More blood than ever,"Diagnosed ulcerative colitis in 2014. Back then I was dealing with periods of having diarrhea 12 times a day with a bit of blood and mucus for weeks on end. Eventually I was put on Humira, was in remission or close to it for many years, in 2023 I had a perianal abscess and was put on skyrizi. 

The past few months I've been in an on and off flare (Skyrizi obviously not working anymore) but the past few days I've been having shooting pains in my intestines (sometimes before gas) and lower back. Occasional diarrhea but when I do have it there's more blood in the bowl than I've ever seen before. I made an appointment with my GI but he's not going to call me until September 11th. When should I go to the ER? I've never taken prednisone before but the amount of blood and this pain is kind of alarming me. Do I just stick it out until September 11th? Going to the ER a couple years ago for the anal abscess was a pretty miserable experience which involved three separate trips and probably a dozen different ER doctors vigorously fingering my asshole so I'd like to avoid it but apparently I can't even talk to my GI for another two weeks.",2025-08-27 03:52:44,CrohnsDisease,3,1n16xhz,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n16xhz/more_blood_than_ever/,2025-08-27
42,Humira,"Why isn't there more patient education about the best way to store Humira and other biologic drugs in the refrigerator, and the importance of not allowing it to freeze for even a second?","Hi everyone, first time posting here.  I started on Humira a few days ago and am already having a stressful experience with it so I thought I would share my thoughts here.  My first injection failed because the pen triggered when I was not expecting it which I think was caused by half-heartedly pushing the button a few times (trying to work up the courage) and I must have pushed it right to the brink which caused it to go off a short time later when I was not ready to receive the injection and it ended up getting wasted.  I was able to get a replacement pen, but now I am worried that my Day 15 dose was ruined because the overnight low on my digital thermometer, kept right next to the Humira on my refrigerator middle door shelf, shows a low of 32.2 F.  Which would probably be OK if not for the fact that I just did an ice water test on my thermometer showing that it actually reads up to 1 degree F warmer than the temperature actually is.  So the temperature was below 32 F around the Humira for an unknown amount of time, which may have been enough to defeat the thermal protection of the pen packaging, starter box the pens came in, and a plastic bag I tied around the box.  I'm going to call Abbvie Monday to see what they think of all this and also ask what the true freezing point of Humira is (my understanding is that it is actually a bit below 32 F, but I don't think it's much).  Anyways, I wish there was more information provided with the induction dose box beyond a simple warning not to freeze it, like some info on the best place to store it in the refrigerator, recommendation on the use of thermometers and coolers in the refrigerator, and some information on what happens when it freezes even for even just a very short time.  I did consider some of these things without the drug pamphlets mentioning any of this, but I would have taken the whole thing even more seriously if there was more mention of it and probably this would not have happened.  I'm upset because I've been reading that screwing up even one dose of your treatment for Crohn's disease can mess up the whole long-term viability of your treatment plan, which is not really the case for other diseases that are treated with Humira.  Anyways, I just wanted to rant about this for a bit so thank you for reading my wall of text and if anyone from Abbvie or some other pharma company is reading this, please educate people better about the importance of not allowing your biologics to freeze for even a second and include some information with the starter kit on how to help prevent freezing so people will take it more seriously.

45,Humira,Failed Humira and Lost My GI in One Fell Swoop,"I (23F) was diagnosed with Crohn’s in October of 2024 and I have been on Humira ever since. Each time I took the Humira I noticed increasingly large and persistent injection site reaction (it started as a mosquito bite and last time I took it I have hives larger than my palm that lasted the two weeks between treatments). When I brought this up at my last doctor’s appointment I was told that my blood work looked good (basically I wasn’t anemic) and that I shouldn’t worry about the rash. Since that appointment I received the results of an antibody test that shows I have a lot of antibodies to the medication and very little Humira in my system (Adalimumab Drug Level
&lt;0.6 and Anti-Adalimumab Antibody 2,328) My doctor said that she doesn’t recommend that I continue with the Humira, but that she also can’t continue to treat me because my case is more complex than she initially thought. She suggested I stop treatment and try to get an appointment at one of the IBD clinics in the city where I live. The problem with this is that I can’t get an appointment until mid-November, meaning I’m basically leaving it untreated until then.

I feel frustrated and betrayed because this doctor has always said that she planned to stay with me until I had a stable medication that was working well for me (please note I was aware she wouldn’t be my permanent GI). When I questioned her decision not to continue treating me, she informed me that the hospital I was going to is not set up for infusions of Crohn’s medication and that she does not have to experience prescribing non-Humira medication for Crohn’s, meaning she was treating me for months with no back up plan if the medication failed. As my parents have pointed out it is probably for the best that I am leaving her practice, but I am worried about leaving things untreated, because in the two years leading up to my diagnosis my life was constantly falling apart and I’m afraid that without treatment everything will get worse again. If anyone has experience with anything like this I would really like to hear your perspective.

46,Humira,Skyrizzi vs rinvoq abroad,"Hi all, I’m in a really rough situation and need some advice from anyone with a similar experience. I’m traveling abroad to France for one year. I’ve gotten COBRA through my work to cover me for 9 months. While the last 3 months + 3 months to get it back from my job when I come back is a huge problem, it’s something to deal with months from now. My bigger issue lies in getting my skyrizzi OBI. I have no clue how to continue getting it while in France. My insurance denied a vacation override (they’re not authorizing a year of OBIs…their fake price is way too much!). I originally thought I could just have it shipped to my parents house and they overnight ship it to me (for a low cost of almost $200 every 8 weeks). But upon investigation, shipping prescription medications is illegal. I looked into Walgreens international shipping but apparently they only ship medications to the UK, not France. Abbvie told me they don’t have OBI 180 ml in France. Does anyone know anything about the Skyrizzi Pen 150ml?? Is that an option for severe Crohn’s disease? My doctor said we could switch to Rinvoq tablets but my skyrizzi JUST started working after 8 months. And I still take loperimide every other day to only ALLEVIATE my diarrhea. Last year I was without medication for just 6 months due to insurance issues and I was in the ER and honestly on the verge of death with the amount of pain I was in and couldn’t take it anymore. If I can’t have access to my medicine I truly don’t know what to do. I feel so hopeless with this disease. Last year I started Humira, after 1 dose I lost insurance. So I couldn’t go back to humira. I feel like if I switch to rinvoq for this next year and build up resistance to Skyrizzi I’m really running myself out of options if one were to fail in the future.

My only association with Crohns was negative. A close friend of mine has intense family history with this disease. The flares, the surgeries, the agonizing recovery, extreme complications. 

Since my partner’s official diagnosis, I’ve been on this sub like it’s my part time job. I’ve been on TikTok (sounds silly, but it’s another way to interact with real people experiencing similar things), researching on the web, you name it. I seem more worried than my partner, thankfully- I think stress has been a huge trigger. 

Reading existing posts and comments has given me some insight and comfort into life with Crohns. It can be manageable and livable. The disease  doesn’t scare me as much anymore - though of course I hope we never have to face a surgery. :’)

I just went down a rabbit hole on this sub, luckily I found an old post where some people shared they’ve been diagnosed for 10+ years without needing surgery. My partner starts Humira soon - any good experiences you can share are appreciated.

48,Humira,Anyone here with Crohn’s on Humira tried Ashwagandha?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease about 2 years ago and I’m currently in remission thanks to Adalimumab (Humira).

I used to take Ashwagandha for 2 weeks mainly for its calming and sleep-supporting effects, and it seemed to help me sleep through the night. However, I recently stopped taking it because I’m concerned about possible immune system interactions – since Ashwagandha is sometimes described as “immune stimulating” (e.g., increasing NK cell and macrophage activity), while Adalimumab works by suppressing certain parts of the immune system (blocking TNF-alpha).

My question is:

Has anyone here with Crohn’s on Adalimumab (or similar biologics) tried Ashwagandha?

Did you notice any changes in your Crohn’s symptoms, bloodwork, or infection frequency?

Any experiences with doctors giving the green light or advising against it?


I’m just trying to figure out if the potential risk is more theoretical or if people have actually experienced flares or issues.

50,Humira,Switching from adalimumab (Abrilada) to Rinvoq for other health issues,"I've been on Humira (and then Abrilada) for more than 10 years for Crohns, and am fortunate that I've been in remission basically the entire time. However, in the last 1.5 years since on Abrilada, I've noticed my immune system is shot and I've had other health issues (which could or could not be related). 

The worst of which is eczema, seb derm, and other skin issues for the last year+, and really flaring since January this year. I've tried all the normal topicals, steroids, etc., but it's not getting better and in some places, getting worse. My dermatologist recommended RInvoq, but after checking with my GI, she obviously said it was not advisable to be on two biologics simultaneously, and that there is a risk of flare in switching medications if I were to try RInvoq for both the eczema and Crohns.

However, in the last few weeks the skin issues have gotten worse, and I'm now considering a switch. I recently had a colonoscopy that came back clean, and my blood work also looks good with no signs of inflammation. Reading other people's experience of switching from Humira / Abrilada to Rinvoq gives me some comfort, but I'm still unsure of whether this would be the right move.

I heard something about how sometimes medication won't reach all the way through the GI tract to the rectum and I'm wondering if that might be the case for me.

52,Humira,Leg pain?,"CD diagnosed 8 years ago. Started Humira around then, and switched to a bio-similar (Hulio) about 2 years ago. Pretty much in remission and recent blood work (May 2025) was all good except low B12, which I'm treating with supplements.

I've been experiencing a new symptom(?): leg pain in and around the knees, shins/calves, sometimes above knee. Feels sort of like muscle strain or a tissue pain but unsure - it is kind of a dull ache, as if I had been on my feet doing manual labor for hours on end, but I haven't been. I have been exercising and walking a bit more than usual as it is summer but nothing major. Is this something to be worried about? It's been off and on since last month or so. Can't tel if it is getting worse or if I am just getting anxious about it and paying more attention to it.

Could it be a symptom of the meds I am on? Since switching to a biosimilar I have had much worse skin reactions than when I was on Humira. Treated with allergy meds and my doc thinks I should just stay on them as my CD remains in remission.

Obviously this could be completely unrelated to Crohn's but figured I'd ask to see if anyone else has experienced this or similar muscle(?) aches?

Edit: just wanted to add I've never had this issue in the past. I've worked jobs that require me to be on my feet for hours on end, done some hard labor, played sports, etc. and no issues. That's what has me freaked out a bit. Obviously could be age + immune issues related CD/meds but curious about others' experiences.

55,Humira,Symptoms getting worse.,"First post here and still in the process of diagnosing. Formally diagnosed with SpA and Uveitis. GI symptoms started back in January and my Rheumatologist was very suspicious we might be dealing with Crohn’s as well.

I have a referral to a GI doctor next week but this weekend, and especially today, my symptoms have been the same but worse than usual to a bit of a concerning degree.

For reference I haven’t had a solid BM since January, I’ve lost nearly 30 lbs, I’m barely able to eat (I maybe get a meal in every 2-3 days), throwing up/dry heaving at least 3x a week, temperature dysregulation, and then just an overall weakness likely from all of the above. 

I started Rinvoq a week ago (9days) after getting Celulitis with my first Humira injection so idk if this is potentially a side effect of the Rinvoq that’s just setting in or if I’m having a bad day due to my body itself but today I’ve already had 12 urgent bathroom runs. I haven’t had anything to eat because my nausea is so bad. I’ve been too weak to get out of bed unless it’s to go to the bathroom. I had a close call/start of an accident in my pants during one of these instances. My BM’s today have also smelt burnt. That’s new.

I know I’m seeing my GI in 10 days but at what point do I say “I’m wasting away.” and go to the hospital? I’ve gone before for similar symptoms before we had an idea that it might be Crohn’s and (no one is surprised) they dismissed me completely and assumed I was drug seeking due to me being in recovery from alcohol, which is in my chart. This was after a d-dimer so high that my dad (a doctor) came into the ER and demanded they at the very least rule out a PE because of the chest pain I was experiencing at the time. They did, then told me it was likely trapped gas and if I had these symptoms again I don’t need to come back in. I’ve had at least half a dozen experiences like that since January and would prefer to avoid that if I can but also at this rate am literally just desperate for help and some type of support. Idk if I need to give my meds more time to work? Idk if this is being made worse by the Rinvoq so I DEFINITELY need to go in? Idk if it’s just a really bad day and this is just a new experience for me so it seems more concerning?

At what point do I cry uncle or do I try to tough it out until my appointment and only go in if things continue to get worse over the next 10 days?",2025-08-05 20:24:02,CrohnsDisease,7,1mikagg,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mikagg/symptoms_getting_worse/,2025-08-05

I'm excited to start something, I've been SO sick since the Humira failed the past year and have been on prednisone and STILL having flares even with that. my diet is literally juice, white rice, miso soup and applesauce or I'll flare.

a) any side effects? My side effects on Humira were HORRIBLE. I heard Entyvios weren't as bad. I'm hopefuly for this! 

b) transfusion experience? I'm super nervous for this, I was on the Humira pen and have never done transfusions. I tried iron transfusions and was allergic and almost died, so any transfusions give me PTSD lol. 

c) Any luck getting the pen, and if so what insurance were you on? It would be easy for me to switch insurance, but they will only approve the transfusion. The pen would be so much easier if I could have that.

It is comforting to know there are others out there that have had similar experiences and I am not totally crazy. I am really at a loss with the state of my health. I am a 22 year old female and whenever I ask the gastroenterologist questions they say I am a ""unique case"" that they have not seen before. I was diagnosed with crohns disease of the large intestine at 8 years old after years of stomach pain and the constant need to rush to the restroom. Flash forward a few years and I have taken pretty much every medication under the sun- Predinisone (chunny cheeks galore), Remicade (the anaphylaxis reaction that followed was no joke), Humira (hives), Rinvoq (just did nothing I guess?) and I have just had my first dose of tremfya which was a double injection.  I have experienced some fun (not fun) side quests due to crohns- fissures, multiple fistulas, antibiotics and more antibiotics, c-tons/packing, 2 separate picc-lines with TPN and fluids, eating disorder (fear of food), and I have had a double loop ileostomy since 2023. The doctors have tried to get imaging through a colonoscopy but there is so much inflammation the camera will not fit through my intestines. The doctors have been trying to find a medication to decrease this inflammation so they can get imaging to figure out next steps- Do they remove part of the colon or the whole thing? Now there is a high suspicion I have developed a rectovaginal fistula and I have voiced my concerns to the gastroenterologist multiple times without much direction. With all this information what I am really asking is- Am I the only one? and if you have experienced this terrible sequence of events as well please PLEASE provide some advice.

This morning I ate an egg sandwich (which usually goes down fine) but I was in pain after that. This makes me feel as if things are not improving. School starts up for me in 4 weeks.

61,Humira,US International Student moving to UK and transferring care question,"I am an international student from the US moving to the UK to start postgraduate studies. I take a series of medications for several chronic health issues. I have paid the IHS and am beginning to familiarize myself with the healthcare system in the UK. My university has its own Health Center that I plan on seeing upon arriving to get started with a GP. 

I take Humira (an injectable medication I use to manage Crohn's disease). I know that because of funding, the NHS may switch me over to a biosimilar to offset costs (which I've discussed with my US doctor and am ok with if it comes to it). However, since it is an already prescribed medication, does anyone know if its something the GP can manage and continue prescribing, or would I need to still be referred to a GI specialist? Anyone else taking Humira for Crohn's in the UK and don't mind sharing their experience? I am anticipating longer wait times but don't know much else.

I do have a short stricture at the terminal ileum anastomosis. 3 years ago at last colonoscopy they had to use a pediatric scope to pass. For the last 10 years I have had intermittent obstructive symptoms due to the stricture, now I have to be careful with how much fiber I eat.. prone to SIBO symptoms as well. None of my GIs have ever mentioned balloon dilation as an option. I finally brought it up and my GI looked over my imaging and last colonoscopy and thinks I’m a good candidate.

One of the common side effects that concern me, are these reports of weight gain.

Is this because people are eating more (after feeling better about eating food, thanks to improvements in Crohns symptoms) ? Or absorbing more (thanks to gut healing) ?

Can anyone speak to their experiences regarding weight gain, and weight control. Did you gain weight whilst eating &amp; exercising the same ? If you gained weight, what adjustments did you make to get it under control ? Just the obvious like at less, exercise more ?

I switched GI doctors to a Crohn’s specialist and have been on Humira and we just increase to weekly dosing. She reassured me that our goal was to come off of all forms of mesalamine because there is little literature proving that it’s effective for Crohn’s. My inflammation is generally concentrated toward the rectum and small portion of the ileum (I was diagnosed quickly so there isn’t much scaring or permanent damage). But it seems like even with the increased dose of Humira, it’s not enough to tackle the inflammation near my rectum and I still need to occasionally use the mesalamine enemas or else I struggle to use the bathroom and pass large amounts of mucus.

For the past 3-4 months I've been having more pain, often after eating but not always, and usually better with Bentyl/dicyclomine. Of course chronic fatigue as well but at this point I'm just accepting it as my baseline.

I went to my GI, got all my tests done end of June and finally got the results - everything was normal.

I'm following up with my doctor about a SIBO test, but he prefaced all this by saying if the results were normal it's likely IBS and not the crohns. 

I guess I'm just frustrated by the lack of explanation for symptoms and wondering if y'all have had similar experiences with being symptomatic despite remission. Any tests I should ask for? Anything that has helped with symptoms?

My doctor says that the remicade/Inflectra was treating both conditions and unfortunatley the Skyrizi is only treating the Crohn’s. 

So - now I’m choosing between Rinvoq and Humira as my next options to try. 

I’m wondering specifically if anyone has failed on one anti-TNF drug and then gone to another and what their experience was? Did it work for you, or did you fail again? Humira and Remicade are both anti-TNF but there may be others too.

72,Humira,Humira and Canada,"Hello everyone!

  
I live in Canada (Ontario) and have had Chron's since 2011 and been on Humira since 2013. Currently, my employer's insurance is largely covering the cost of Humira. 

However, I have the following questions and I was hoping to hear some advice on this.

1) The province of Ontario has now stopped providing coverage for Humira and is forcing everyone on biosimilars. I am a bit hesitant to do this as Humira has been working well for me all this time. **Has anyone here switched from Humira to a biosimilar? How long were you on Humira for? Which biosimilar did you switch to? How long has it been since you made the switch? What has your experience been? Did it work? Side effects?**

2) I called the Humira support team and they said that the only way to continue Humira is now through private insurance. Does anyone if there is private affordable insurance in Canada for people with Chrons? Since I am a person with a pre-existing medical condition, I imagine the insurance premiums will be so high that it won't make sense.

3) How cheap are biosimilars in Canada? Are they generally well subsidized by private/public plans? Do you find them to financially accessible?

I am really looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Much appreciated!

Sorry for the long post, but I’m looking for recommendations for a small, foldable, adjustable cane that you can either add a seat to or has one attached that’s also discrete. My wrists aren’t great, but I’m looking for something I can take with me on adventures with my kids so I can take a break or use the support if needed.

I’m a mom to 2 young boys and got diagnosed with Graves disease last year, and for context have Hashimoto’s antibodies. I have been bouncing back and forth between hyper and hypo, especially after a very painful pop in my neck occurred on April 15th causing a major flare, getting me admitted to the hospital (inflamed liver and appendix), and eventually leading to this newly added diagnosis, Seronegative Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease. My Rheumatologist thinks it’s a possible overlap of Lupus, SpA, and IBD (IgG + only so far) but we are focusing on SpA and IBD for now and started the Humira pen injection. Any experiences?

Also, I would love to hear anyone else’s experience getting diagnosed with their autoimmune disease/s. Especially, if anyone has an overlap or experience with Lupus, Spondyloarthritis and IBD. I am testing negative for everything besides IgG (IgA is negative) and I am waiting to get my MRI of my sacroiliac joints. 

My symptoms are vast, but I just finished a 10 day Medrol tapering and TMI, but I also have been having issues with my GI system.

74,Humira,My 20 Year Experience With IBD,"Hello Everyone,

Like many of you, I came to this sub only recently. I'm a very private person, thanks in no small part to IBD (Crohn's here). I understand too well how isolating it can make one feel. With that in mind I would like to share my experience dealing with ""The Goodie Bag"" of issues we're all familiar with, hopefully something will resonate with you.

 At any rate, here's my rap sheet:

-38M, Crohn's Disease. Symptomatic at 16, diagnosed at 18.

-Bipolar I, Severe Panic Disorder, ADHD. Luckily I've just recently gotten the right mix down with the addition of Vraylar.

-3 small bowel resections (2007, 2013, 2019) each time at the terminal ileum. The last one left me with an incisional hernia that needs operated on. It's not hyperbole to say I can't do much of anything at the moment 😅

-I've taken every pill , Prednisone is the only one that works but it comes with damn near every side effect listed so emergencies only.

-Bios I've taken so far are Remicade, Entyvio, Stelara, Humira, and most recently Rinvoq (failed a few months ago). I am currently changing care teams due to issues I won't go into here, but I am most likely up for another resection, and likely likely an ostomy. I have inflammation in a decent stretch of small bowel, I am obstructed at my resection site to the degree that I can only tolerate liquids.

I've been on leave from work for 6 months now, financially I'm a wreck but I am fortunate to have a place to live with family. If I could give one piece of advice other than taking care of your IBD, take care of your mental health as best you can. They feed off of each other something nasty, and the days I can get out of bed are due to it. I shrugged off therapy for years, but if you can swing it absolutely do it.

75,Humira,Is Humira a dead drug?,"I just had a follow up with my gastrointerologist and the majority of our conversation was about all or most insurances not covering Abbvie’s Humira.  

He told me Abbie has been preparing to stop servicing Humira for a few years now and with the patent expiring, this is the year they have done it.  He said adalimumab is an amazing drug for fistulating Crohn’s Disease and he hates that everyone is being pushed to other generics because he has seen many of his patients experience “break through” where the generic drug doesn’t work at keeping patients in remission.  

I asked him to elaborate why Abbvie would stop servicing Humira and he said they are trying to move patients over to Skyrizi which is technically a different class of biologic.  He said if you try to get rebate programs or ambassadors for Humira, they are basically not making it easy to get in touch with anyone.  

Is any of this true?  My understanding was Blue cross blue shield and other insurances simply didn’t want to pay for Humira anymore because there are cheaper options.  It seems strange to me that Abbvie wouldn’t just lower the cost of Humira to $1400 a dose to compete with the other brands like Amjevita and Hadlima.  Why completely kill a drug that still has use for Crohn’s patients?

Anyone have any insight on this and also, is there anyone in here still having Humira covered by their insurance?  ",2025-06-19 19:56:35,CrohnsDisease,107,1lfkdxf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lfkdxf/is_humira_a_dead_drug/,2025-06-19
76,Humira,So anyone use Thiopurines to clear out biologic antibodies?,"Hey all! I had an appointment today with my GI doc because we had been discussing treatment options due to high antibodies to Humira/Hadlima. I also have ankylosing spondylitis, so the meds would treat both diseases. I got labs today to see if I can use thiopurines to basically clear my antibody cache and allow Remicade a fighting chance to take charge. 

If I can take the meds, that is great news for possible remission, but I’m trying to avoid the spiral with the 1:45k people who take this developing an aggressive and fatal lymphoma. Long story short, I have yet to have any meds (including prednisone) really do anything for symptoms and I have developed a copper deficiency problem that is an unknown to most doctors as being possible. I know there are frequent labs done to check on blood levels and organ damage with the Thiopurines use, but I’m just trying to not get down about the slight risk of the cancer. I understand that cancer is a risk with everything, especially not getting treatment for things like IBD, so I’m going to get treatment all the same. Anyone have any good experience with these meds?


TLDR: I’m a bit nervous about a possible treatment that has a very rare chance of an aggressive fatal cancer and needing some positive experiences or words to help calm my mind.

77,Humira,Keep getting skin infections,Not sure if this is the right place to ask or if there is a subreddit better suited but I am 19 yr just finished my second year of college. I started taking Humira in early junior year of high school so about 3 almost 4 years now. I love it I feel way better but this past I’d say year maybe year and a half I’ve been getting quite a few skin infections. I had one bad one in senior year but it went away on its own before we knew if was an infection. They thought it was something else. Then last April I got a belly button infection. I had gone to the er for extreme constipation pain and they noticed my belly button was swollen and took a cat scan and saw the infection. They kept me for a day and a half for monitoring once they realized it was not too bad of an infection the next morning they just wanted to be sure. Then about half a year later I want to say it got infected again. This time it got way grosser and was painful which hadn’t happened the first time. I tried antibiotics and they didn’t work so we tried a different type. Then a few months ago I noticed what looked like a big bee sting on my shoulder and found out it was another infection. Like their previous time it took two separate rounds of different antibiotics to heal it and I still have a small red dot months later. The weirdest part was during my second course of antibiotics for my shoulder my old scar from the leg infection got red puffy and oozed again. I should also say it was not the same thing each time. The leg was seratia I believe and the belly button was something with an a the first time then the others were staph. I’ve heard infections can become more common the longer you’re on them but is there something I should be doing to better prevent them? I also seem to be developing a tolerance for antibiotics which sucks. Amoxicillin straight up doesn’t work and now it seems clindamycin which had been working is no longer working. I just had a tooth get infected and found out that way it had stopped being effective and yet again had to change antibiotics. I’m at a loss for how to prevent this. I don’t wear long nails as much as I used to but that doesn’t seem to be helping. I’m so confused on if I’m missing something I’m supposed to be doing or if o just have to put up with all these infections. They usually leave a scar so I’d prefer not to keep getting them.

81,Humira,Remission After 10 Years – You Can Do It Too!,"
Hey everyone,

I'm absolutely stoked to share some incredible news: after a decade, I've officially achieved full remission from Crohn's! Seriously, I was diagnosed when I was 10, and it's been a long, challenging road.

Last year, when my doctor found a severe stricture in my small intestine, something just clicked. I realized I couldn't keep putting ""poison"" into my body and expect to get better. That's when I made a drastic change that completely transformed my quality of life.

For me, the game-changer was the CDED diet, especially incorporating Modulen regularly. I know ""we are what we eat"" is a common saying, but for those of us with Crohn's, it's the absolute truth. I'd been on Humira for seven years, and while it helped, it wasn't until I truly overhauled my diet that I felt truly alive again.

I genuinely believe in every single one of you in this sub. If I can do it, you can too. Don't lose hope.

Has anyone else found a specific dietary approach that's made a huge difference for them? I'd love to hear your experiences!

I was wondering if anyone else developed paradoxical psoriasis after using Stelara? I was on Humira first for about 1.5 years, and developed horrible psoriasis. My doctor switched me to Stelara and I have been good on that for 6 years. Recently developed something I was pretty sure was psoriasis and just got confirmed at the dermatologist this morning. We are going to try a topical medication to see if that helps before switching biologics again.

87,Humira,Experience with Med Changes,"My daughter (14) was diagnosed almost 5 years ago. 

She tried Remicade early on and had a reaction. Was switched to Humira and about 6 months in to that, it stopped working. When that happened, all of her symptoms came back almost overnight (20+ diarrheas/day, stomach pain, nausea).

Now she’s been on Stelara for over 3.5 years, every 4 weeks. It’s been a godsend. As long as she doesn’t eat her trigger foods, she has no symptoms (no pain, nausea, 3 formed, BMs/day). If she does eat a trigger food, she’ll usually have a day or two of increased bathroom visits which may or may not be diarrhea and then she’s back to normal. Remission hasn’t been mentioned, but she also has had scopes since not longer after she started Stelara.

Over the last week or so, her BM frequency increased to 4/day. Then last night she was up to go during the night. Now I’m paranoid. Of course, we’ll pay close attention and call her GI if necessary.

TLDR: I’m curious to hear experiences of switching medications when the current one is slowly failing. Was it a cold turkey switch? Did your GI give steroids while the new med had time to start working?",2025-06-08 12:00:39,CrohnsDisease,4,1l6ahfi,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l6ahfi/experience_with_med_changes/,2025-06-08

90,Humira,Humira Update,"  I wanted to share my story and hopefully give some of you hope.

Last year, I had a horrible flare-up that forced me to see a doctor. I genuinely thought I was dying. After a colonoscopy, they found a stricture and severe inflammation—my intestines were 90% closed. Honestly, it was scary as hell.

They recommended I start Humira, which felt even scarier. In times of major stress like that, you come to Reddit hoping for reassurance—but all you usually see are the horror stories. I waited two months, terrified the medication would kill me, cause cancer, or trigger a heart attack the second I injected it. But the pain kept getting worse, to the point where it already felt like I was dying.

Eventually, I told my wife, “I’m done avoiding this because of fear. I’m not going to let anonymous posts dictate my health.” The truth is, most people who post online are looking for help or venting. You rarely hear the success stories—because those people are out living their lives. Just like me now.

I recently had my annual colonoscopy, and I’m proud to say 80% of the inflammation is gone. I feel amazing. I have regular, healthy bowel movements. I eat well most of the time (though I cheat occasionally with spicy food), but I steer clear of broccoli—had a bad experience with that one.

If you’re in the thick of it right now, trust your doctors. The longer you wait, the more it can progress. I truly believe we’re getting closer to real solutions with the rise of AI and medical technology.

Stay strong—and know that better days do come.

93,Humira,What does remission look like for you?,"I’ve been having a shocking few days recently and I’ve come to the realisation that I seriously am not helping myself in any way. So I wanted to know for those of you who have managed to reach remission, how did you achieve that, did you have to make any permanent changes, such as never having a certain food ever again? (I already know onions is a no go)

Bit about me: 
Diagnosed when I was 17, March 2023, I was on adalimumab (humira) for two years, it worked for around 7 months and then I was just raw dogging life through random courses of prednisolone after that. I’ve recently swapped to risankizumab (skyrizi) and I’m about a week off from getting my 3rd loading dose, I’ve not seen any improvement apart from a reduction in joint pain, so hoping the third kicks it into gear. 

Anywho here’s a list of stuff I am currently doing that I know is not aiding my Crohn’s atm. 

1. I vape 
Planning on quitting, I’ve done it before cold turkey and it lasted 8 months, and I started again as I’d been going out more, and it naturally turned into a habit again. But a lot of the time it acts as a laxative, which gives me that extra push to help me go to the toilet when I’m in pain, which is good for when I’m in a rush in the mornings, because I could be stuck driving and suddenly have extremely bad urgency. 

2. I still eat takeaways and ultra processed foods. 
I’ll have a good few days and then when I’ve got nothing planned for a couple of days, I might treat myself to a wingstop or a Chinese, I know the consequences of this, but I still do it, as I’ve struggled with a binge eating disorder my whole life, and food was a huge enjoyment for me before. I don’t ’binge’ too often anymore but I struggle to avoid these types of foods. Has anyone in remission managed to have these once in a while and not have extremely negative effects? 

3. I drink alcohol. 
This isn’t a thing I do often as it really fucks me up for a few days, so when I do drink, it’s a go big or go home, I can never justify messing my stomach up for a couple of glasses of wine. Are you able to still drink occasionally in remission without putting yourself into a flare? 

So has anyone had to stick to a strict meal plan, maybe get rid of carbonated drinks permanently? I know the answers to a load of these questions will be so subjective as this disease affects everyone differently but I just want some insight, as I’m starting uni in September and I just know I won’t cope if I’m still in an active flare by then. I just want a good experience and to be able to enjoy doing things people my own age do, I’ve feel like I’ve missed out on so much ",2025-05-29 15:03:54,CrohnsDisease,2,1kyd3ad,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kyd3ad/what_does_remission_look_like_for_you/,2025-05-29
94,Humira,What are your Safe Foods when in a flare?,"Hello,

This is my first reddit post, so please forgive me if I'm missing any normal etiquette. 

I've hit a point with my Crohn's that I'm just tired of feeling so terrible for so long. I was diagnosed when I was 12, and that was 25 years ago. It was very aggressive right from the start, and after only 3 years, I had a total removal of my colon and rectum and had an ileostomy put in. That helped big time, but I've never really had it in remission. There's been many revisions to the ostomy and other times where they just took more sections of small bowel out. For about 7 years now, I've been on Tylenol, Hydromorphone, and Buprenorphine patch to try to keep gut pain manageable. They assume that the pain comes from the amount of times I've been cut open, scar tissue, lesions and whatnot. 

Basically, if I don't eat anything, I feel relatively normal. But as soon as I have food in my system, I feel terrible. We know that I have a stricture and a couple of ulcers toward the end of my tract. Over the 25 years of dealing with Crohn's, I've been on many diets. I didn't find any of them especially helpful, so I've just ended up avoiding foods that for sure bother me. Mostly the obvious stuff, Corn, Nuts, Raw Veggies, Chips,  too much greasy food. My typical day of food is 2 small yogurt cups for breakfast, homemade waffles for lunch, and some type of pasta (spaghetti, KD, ramen) for supper. I do have a sweet tooth and tend to want some kind of candy or popsicle or packaged cake/pastry for dessert. 

I've realized how terrible my diets been for a while, and have been drinking boost, taking vitamins and supplements lately, and my wife even has me using some patches to absorb more vitamins and glutamine. 

As far as meds goes, I've been through Humira (worked okay for 6 or 7 years), Stelara (did nothing), I was on IV infusions of Entyvio once a month, but that wasn't controlling things well enough, so we switched to Rinvoq last year, which didn't seem to do anything either. Now I'm still on Rinvoq, but also taking Entyvio as an injection every 2 weeks. I was on Azothioprine right from when i was diagnosed, but the doc took me off of that once we started Rinvoq.

Anyway, all of that history just to say, I still feel terrible. I feel like I've gotten lazy when it comes to paying attention to what actually bothers my guts. Ya I know the obvious stuff, but there's got to be things that are triggering inflammation without obvious immediate feedback. So I want to completely overhaul my diet and see if I can figure out more trigger foods. That's where you all come in. I'm looking for recommendations on safe foods that don't bother you when in a flare. I want to start right from the basics and slowly reintroduce foods to see if they make me feel worse or not.

 If anyone has gone through this process, I'd love to hear your experience and any suggestions as well. I was thinking of starting with Rice and Chicken. No sugar and no dairy to start. I wanted to include my waffles, but I don't know if gluten might be considered a trigger. 



TLDR - Long history of aggressive Crohn's, looking for suggestions on foods that don't bother you when in a flare up so that I can stick to those and slowly reintroduce new foods to hopefully find triggers.

98,Humira,"Current Flare, C. diff, and Treatment Journey – Looking for Advice","I’ve been in a flare for the past 2.5 years. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s 5.5 years ago and initially went on Azathioprine and Entocort. About 6 months later, I had a flare and was switched to Humira.

Humira worked reasonably well for about 2.5 years, but I had to increase the dosage every 9 months—first from monthly to bi-weekly, then to weekly. Eventually, I developed high levels of antibodies, and Humira stopped being effective.

I was then moved to Stelara, which I stayed on for about 18 months. Dosing was increased from every 8 weeks to every 6, but the results weren’t great. About a year ago, I transitioned to Entyvio. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen much relief on it either. Dosage also increased from 8 weeks, now currently at 4 week intervals.

So far this year, I’ve been on three 6-week courses of prednisone and two rounds of Entocort. A couple of weeks ago, I tested positive for C. diff. I was prescribed a 10-day course of Vancomycin which I completed and now my doctor has started me on Flagyl for 15 days.

Since starting Flagyl, I’ve been feeling terrible—flu-like symptoms, extreme fatigue, and bad mushy diarrhoea.

If anyone has experience managing C. diff on top of Crohn’s, especially while on biologics, I’d appreciate any advice. Also open to thoughts on managing flares better to finally get my CD under control.

99,Humira,1 Week Until My Colectomy - Advice Appreciated!,"I've been lurking and reading as many surgery stories on here but still have some questions so I decided to make a post to help ease my worries.

Quick background, F32, diagnosed 10 years ago, I had an abscess and fistula near my Ilium. We were hesitant about cutting it out because medicine could be used to make the abscess go away and once I was on Humira I seemed to be in remission again.

Fast forward 8 years, I built up antibodies for Humira and began flairing. Tried Stellara, did not work. Now I've been on Skyrizi for a year and just got approved for taking it every 4 weeks and that has helped with the inflammation a bit.

However, the original scar tissue near my illum caused a stricture and I got a new GI doctor that wasn't scared to do a colonoscopy while I was flairing. He confirms it's nasty and a miracle i haven't had a bowel obstruction.  (Even with the balloon method he wasn't about to see past that area)

So now I'm scheduled to have the stricture/fistula (yeah, that just stayed apparently it's shaped like a clover) and appendix removed laproscopically on May 28th. I'm not sure how much will be removed but it's not supposed to be too much. The surgeon told me while he makes sure there is no leakage after reconnecting the tissues he'll finish completing a full colonoscopy so we can see what my small intestine looks like from the inside.

So my questions/worries are:

1) If while probing the new area, if he sees a diseased area there will he just remove it or does he have to inform me to get permission first? Could he ask my husband for permission? 

For the most part my pain is mainly on my right side where the stricture is, though some MRIs have shown inflammation on the left side before. Pain isn't consistent there though like the right. (I can't wait to have it cut out)

2) This is dumb, but ladies have you dealt with having your period while getting surgery? It happens to be the week it happens since I take the pill to manage my irregular periods. My surgeon said to just wear a pad but I worry about leaking.

3) What was the recovery period like for you? How long until you could eat normally again? How long until you could be intimate again? How long until you could do social activities again?

4) And have any ladies gotten pregnant after having a resection surgery? Did you have to go to a special OBGYN? Once I'm healed up my husband and I want to start trying for a family.

I'd appreciate whatever feedback, experiences, stories, and advice you're willing to give. Thank you to this community for existing as it's helped ease a decent amount of worries and helped me not feel like I'm alone dealing with this disease.

106,Humira,New to biologics,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with crohns in 2021 after years of trying to figure out what my GI symptoms were caused by. Even then though, the biopsies and labs were inconclusive, I had a normal calprotectin, and the doctor basically said “well, we just assume because you have chronic mild inflammation, at this point, it must be crohn’s”. The inflammation I have is also contained to my terminal ileum, and it’s never spread elsewhere. It felt scary at the time to go on an immunosuppressant with such little evidence, so I made the probably unwise choice to go without treatment at all and try to manage it through diet / lifestyle / etc, hoping that it might not be crohn’s.

Fast forward to the end of last year, and I was still experiencing my primary symptom of unhealthy bowel movements. No blood, but usually loose, sometimes too hard, etc. I had another round of testing and a second colonoscopy, as well as MRI, and the inflammation had progressed quite a bit to where my doctor said she could start to see early signs of possible scar tissue and narrowing (although my blood work / calprotectin is still normal). This scared me, so I immediately went on budesonide. 

I’ve been on budesonide now for about 6 months. Not totally sure if it’s taken care of the inflammation, as I still don’t have entirely healthy bowel movements, so my doctor has decided I should take the step to get on a biologic. I’m quite scared of taking such a powerful medication. It’s also difficult to weigh in my situation, because I’m mostly asymptomatic aside from my bowel movements, so this is mostly for assurance that I don’t experience complications that require surgery or other emergency interventions down the road.

It sounds like I’ll likely be put on Humira. I really want to go on Skyrizi, but the price and feasibility is out of the question on my current insurance. What are your experiences on Humira? For anyone on Skyrizi, how do you feel about it in comparison to anti-TNF drugs? Ultimately I would like to be on Skyrizi due to the more targeted nature and better safety profile, but that will probably have to wait. Just looking for reassurance that Humira is the right choice for now.

108,Humira,Post op recovery/marijuana use,"
Hello. I am M(24) , I was diagnosed with Crohn’s when I was 13 and as of tomorrow the 28th, exactly a month ago I had my first and hopefully only 🤞 small bowel surgery which included 1.5ft of my small bowel being removed. This all started right around September-October, during those months I was having trouble receiving my Humira as we faced complications with my insurance company, doctor, Humira, etc. it was very frustrating and we came to realize this all could have most likely been avoided but sometimes life throws you a curveball! 

In November, I was first admitted to the hospital with abscesses and fistulas in my small bowel which led to me being sent home on antibiotics just to find myself back in the hospital and being sent home again with the same antibiotics three separate times up until surgery (very frustrating). 

At the end of March, I had my first and only surgery where I had 1.5ft of my small intestine removed and the first few days post-op things were going well until shit hit the fan. I had a leak from the surgical site causing an infection on the right side of my abdomen. 

The last month has been pretty crazy, after we found out about the infection , they put a drain in my abdomen to clear out the infection and then that was removed after about five days right before I was finally sent home (I was in the hospital for ten days post-op). 

I was home for about a week on oral antibiotics and then out of the blue started getting chills and a fever and found myself right back in the hospital for a long weekend. I was sent home again, this time with a ‘mid-line’ IV so I could continue IV antibiotics but once again after about a week of being home, the chills and fever came back and now I have been in the hospital since last Friday with the same infection/abscesses in the right side of my abdomen. Both times before the fever and being re-admitted, I was feeling good at home and was just going along with the recovery process day by day. 

Since then, they have placed another drain in the right side of my abdomen to clear the infection/abscesses. CT scan showed that the infection is getting a lot better and after a long week and a half, I should be going home tomorrow with the drain, in hopes that it does its job this time (especially since now I will have it in a lot longer than just five days like before).

The last couple of days I have felt a lot better! My bloodwork has been good and I should be going home without any antibiotics (just the drain) this time hoping we are at the end of this journey. 

I am definitely skeptical and nervous as this has been a repetitive cycle over the last six or so months and I just want it to be over. I have read other posts of what others have been through but I felt that maybe I could calm my own nerves by posting my own experience and see if others have any similarities or could share their experiences as well. 

I also wanted to make this post to discuss that I am a daily user of medical marijuana. I have been for about 2-3 years now. When I was initially sent home after surgery the first time (10-15 days post op) I was trying to steer clear of the physical act of smoking but I still obviously wanted to get high as it is sort of my comfort zone. So I was using edibles up until I got the first fever where I found myself back in the hospital. When I was sent home the second time (15-20 days post op) I started actually smoking again and both times while using after being in the hospital, the weed most definitely calmed my nerves and made me feel good just like how it always has but I am skeptical of everything because I am indeed a hypochondriac. 

I have talked to my Dr about my use, they were okay with it and more worried about possible withdrawal symptoms from MJ which I did not experience. 

I should be going home tomorrow and there is nothing I want to do more than to smoke a J outside on my porch as I have been held in this hospital for what feels like forever. Again I am skeptical, and being someone who freaks out about everything I question whether the weed/smoking could be the reason for my frequent hospital stays and infections so that is why I wanted to post all of this to gain some insight from others. 

We do know that taking the drain out the first time was very premature (as to why the infection most likely came back as it was never fully healed) and also as to why I’m being sent home with the drain this time around to make sure we get it right this time! 

So please enlighten me with your stories and suggestions as I hope I am not the only one out there who has been through something like this. Also to my fellow marijuana users, how recovery went for you and whether or not I should steer clear of weed for a bit even though that is the last thing I want to do as again it’s sort of my comfort zone and stress reliever.

Will get my biopsy results in two weeks, but in the meantime, the doctor is considering Renvoq vs Tremfya vs Skyrizi. Would appreciate any feedback on anyone who has made the switch.  I also have guttate psoriasis which I have forgotten about since being on Humira.

113,Humira,Taking the Leap to A Dual Therapy,"Diagnosed with UC in 2014. Neither mesalamine nor Humira worked for me. Simponi did well for 1-2 years, then lost efficacy. Moved to Entyvio which was a godsend for 3-4 years. True remission during that time...it was fantastic.

Flared in 2021. It was bad. Amped up the Entyvio dosage with no luck. Stelara was a bust. Backtracked to Remicade since I skipped over it, but no dice. Zeposia was a womp womp. Between the time needed to try all of those and various life circumstances, I was in a really bad spot for 2 years.

Then we came to Rinvoq (and a coincidental diagnosis change to Crohn's; what a joy). 30mg didn't work but 45mg made a big difference, and my GI has kept me on that off label dosage ever since.

Fast forward to 2 months ago...and wouldn't ya know it? Flare. It hasn't gotten as awful as before though I added Uceris 2 weeks ago as a stopgap. With the only remaining non-surgical options being Skyrizi and Tremfya, my GI has reco'd a dual therapy of Rinvoq and Tremfya. I got a 2nd opinion at his urging, and she agrees.

There's little empirical data on this type of dual therapy but both docs are cautiously optimistic. Has anyone here tried a similar dual therapy? What was your experience?

There's also a clinical trial for a new med tentatively scheduled to start in Nov, and they think I'll be a good candidate.

114,Humira,Adding Humira to Entyvio?,"Hey all,

After being in a rough spot with my Crohn's for the last couple years (was on Remicade for 15 years, then Skyrizi, now Entyvio), my GI yesterday made the recommendation to add Humira to the mix on top of the Entyvio.

She believes the combo of gut-focused infusion from the Entyvio (every 6 weeks) and the full body anti-inflammatory work of the Humira (every 2 weeks) would perhaps work in tandem well to get my symptoms under control. 

Has anyone else worked with this combo before? It was the first I'd heard of taking two ""main"" Crohn's meds together, but doc seemed confident in the concept and mentioned this wasn't an uncommon practice. 

Any experience? Thoughts? Feedback? All is welcome! Appreciate you in advance 🥰",2025-04-11 15:29:02,CrohnsDisease,2,1jwsn57,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jwsn57/adding_humira_to_entyvio/,2025-04-11

116,Humira,Fistula + ileostomy,"Hi everyone this post is to call to anyone who may have the same situation as me to share their experience and also to be informative. 
I am a 25M been diagnosed with Crohns since i was 16yo. 


Over the years i have been on multiple biologics and medicines, namely and in order; steroids, mezalimine, humira, entivyo, stellara, remicade, thalidomide. 
Last year as i was living my best life ever since being diagnosed with crohns i had a sudden flare up which lasted almost a month which then directly led to a surgery for a fistula i had developed. I spent a month in the hospital. 
After being discharged and being taken off the painkillers they had me on in the hospital the pain and flare just got worse and i had to be readmitted to have an emergency ileostomy surgery. 


At the time my large intestine was so severely flared that the best option was to remove it but my family and i decided to hang on to it and have it treated while it was getting rest from the ileostomy. 


Its been almost a year now since the surgeries, and i was prescribed methotrexate. I haven’t improved much and the pain of the fistula still keeps me restrained (not being able to move freely, sit properly and being constantly in check of the discharge) there seems to be no healing there. 


The doctors have suggested to try another biological or some medications or to lose my large intestine completely but I’m honestly just getting really fed up at this point i feel like i’ve become a slave to my disease and have had to live life according to it while also wasting some of the best years of my life either in the hospital or unable to do anything. 


Sorry if this post was rather long but if anyone has ever suffered from the same feat and tried some alternative way of treatments or just have a similar story i would appreciate them sharing it, i really hope that there is light at the end of this tunnel.

117,Humira,Remicade Weight Gain,"First post on this subreddit and I could really use some advice. I have a complicated medical history as many on here do. I have Crohn’s disease, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis, hypothyroidism, and chronic fatigue, chronic musculoskeletal pain due to hypermobility and related muscle dysfunction/tension. My doctor also suspects I have POTs but I’ve yet to confirm with all the testing. My mom has a severe case of POTS. 

My health issues began when I was around 15-16 and it’s been a long and winding road filled with many specialists, tests, surgeries, physical therapists, and experimentation with both conventional and naturopathic forms of medication. I’m going to keep this post as specific to my crohn’s journey as possible.

Back in early 2018 I went on Humira and Prednisone for ulcers and pain. I felt crappy on Humira so I switched to Cimzia but that also didn’t seem to make a huge difference. This was before I’d cut gluten and dairy out of my diet, which I now understand are big triggers for me. At that time I was also on hormonal birth control for the endo, as well as an antidepressant (can’t remember which one at that time). I went from 170ish to 187 in under a year. 170 was already high as around 160 seems to be my set weight (I’m 5’ 8” with DD boobs and a bigger butt). At the end of 2018 I was so fed up with the medical system and my doctors not listening to me that I decided to go off birth control and cimzia, then went on a strict elimination diet and also started talking Levothuroxine because I discovered I also had hypothyroidism. In 4 months I was down to 150lbs. Granted that may have been a little too low for me because of how limited my diet was for that time, but I felt SO much better than I did when I was on the immunosuppressants and birth control. I should also note that my GI doctor had some question marks around my crohn’s diagnosis at the time, as my ulcer biopsies didn’t come back positive for crohn’s, so I was honestly skeptical I even had it. 

Fast forward to early 2022 and symptoms like frequent diarrhea and abdominal pain began to become more and more active and I finally had  to accept the fact that I needed to find a new GI doctor that I trusted and figure out once and for all if I have Crohn’s. I was also dealing with a bout of depression and was prescribed Lexapro, which I still take to this day (20mg). That made me gain about 5lbs in the first 6 months. At some point in 2022 I also went back on birth control in an attempt to help my very heavy and painful periods and hormonal acne that blew up out of nowehere. It wasn’t until February 2023 and two colonoscopies later, once my ulcers had spread throughout my entire intestines, that I was officially diagnosed with a confirmed positive biopsy. I started a 2 month course of budesonide and began getting remicade infusions in late February 2023. Even at that time, when I was going to the bathroom up to 6 times a day and throughout the night, I was never grossly underweight; I was about 165. By June, I was 170, despite paying a great deal of attention to my diet, doing Pilates around 4 sometimes 5 times per week, and walking an average of 30-60 mins every day. 

Fast forward once more to September 2024 and I’m up to 175, feeling incredibly sluggish, swollen and puffy all over (wedding ring started feeling tight), but thought maybe it was some weight gain and fatigue flaring due to going on my honeymoon and 2 work trips in July and not having enough time to recover. I decided to go off my birth control because it was making me never want to have sex with my husband, and I just wanted to experience a normal cycle and maybe forgot how bad my period pain could really get. I also may try to get pregnant in the next few years so figured I’d see what going off felt like. I also decided to start counting calories again, increase my walking to 4-6 miles daily, even even spent a few weeks mainly consuming soups and smoothies. The scale didn’t budge, and then it continued to go up. At the same time, my hormonal acne, which had gotten more under control on birth control (Yaz) but still not perfect, flared up like crazy. Big, painful cysts all around my jawline, chin, even cheeks and occasionally forehead. 

I wanted to stick it out to see how my skin could adjust after months off the birth control, but I only made it to my 4th period since going off the Yaz in September before the pain made me think “what am I doing, I should go back on.” I also have a tendency to feel guilty for not taking a medication that a doctor claims is my best option. I went back on Yaz mid-Jan 2025 and the side effects were worse than ever. More swollen than ever (literally couldn’t wear my wedding ring), felt super tired and low and antisocial and nauseous got even worse. My GYN told me to get off it once again. She tried to push an IUD but I’m just not comfortable with that right now, and honestly feel like my hormones need a break after all the ups and downs lately. 

It’s now the last day of March 2025 and I’ve been off the Yaz for about 25 days. My intense cravings and potentially some of the moodiness and swelling have improved, but the scale isn’t budging. I’m now up to 182lbs. I should mention that in late December 2024, I had a colonoscopy to assess my Remicade progress, and my doctor declared me in remission from active Crohn’s; all my ulcers had healed. While I’m not going to the bathroom as much as I was before and some of the acute abdominal pain is a lot better, I just….. still don’t feel great, or like myself. I feel so guilty because I feel like I should be over the moon to know I’m in remission. The issue that many forget about is that Crohn’s is just one of many systemic issues I deal with, and the rest is still there. Remicade also hasn’t helped my chronic musculoskeletal pain because it’s not inflammatory arthritis of the joints, it’s muscular. 

I’ve been having an increasingly hard time waking up in the morning. My body feels so heavy, like it’s leaden, my brain is foggy, my body hurts, and I feel like no matter how much I sleep, I don’t feel rested. I struggle some with disordered eating due to years of stomach issues, and sometimes I go between undereating during the day due to lack of appetite to bingeing or at least overeating at night after consuming medical marijuana, which I use for anxiety, pain, and sleep. I haven’t been eating “perfect” but I still eat really healthy compared to move, avoid gluten and dairy 99% of the time, don’t drink soda or juice and drink alcohol maybe once a month, often less. 

It just feels like my body is working against me and while it’s great my ulcers have healed, I don’t want to feel this way forever. I just find it so odd that all 3 immunosuppressants I’ve tried have resulted in significant weight gain despite me not being underweight to begin with. Yes, I understand that intestinal healing = greater nutrient absorption and potentially eating more due to feeling better, but this isn’t just 5 pounds. I have a feeling it’s a combination of all the different medications I take or have taken over the years (been on like 13 different antidepressants since I was 13 and I know those can effect metabolism long term) but there is no denying the consistent and significant weight increase since adding in Remicade. My doctor parrots the talking points about the medication itself not making you gain weight, but the increased nutrient absorption and ability to eat more foods can inadvertently lead to weight gain. 

I don’t want to sound like I don’t respect science, but I also know my body. I know this doesn’t feel normal. In fact it feels awful. I’m at the point where I am strongly considering adding Zepbound into the mix. My GI doctor says she will prescribe it for me, but I can’t tell if she actually thinks it’s a good idea and could help me, or if she just wants to get me off her back. I’ve read anecdotal stories of people saying it worked miracles in helping them lose stubborn weight from medications, and I’ve even read some accounts that some feel it’s helped their autoimmune conditions and/or pain. Of course there’s also the risk of negative side effects, especially ones like GI discomfort, pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Am I crazy to even consider this knowing that I just finally got the Crohn’s under control? Why does a part of me feel like medical research hasn’t gotten there yet, but that GLP-1s could potentially be great supplemental medications for certain autoimmune conditions? 

Any input is really appreciated. Stay kind &lt;3

118,Humira,Should I take biologics (Humira),"LONG READ FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN DETAILS, TLDR DOWN BELOW:

QUESTIONS AT THE END NUMBERED 




LONG STORY: So I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease 4 years back. 

I was on a diet of formula powder called Modulen IBD by Nestle twice which brought inflammation down and stabilised me. (My poop was sausaged shaped with no blood or mucus, wasn't tired, nutritional deficiencies were back to normal )

After both times it regressed mainly due to factors like stress and regressing back to unhealthy eating like junk food/outside food at lot due to various things. 

Crohn's is currently I'd say ok, I have inflammation at the start and end of my large intestine and that's it. I currently deal with mild constipation and occasional semi-loose stools, occasionally with mucus and even less so blood. No stomach pain and really I barely even know I have it until I shit. I can eat a lot of the foods I really shouldn't like junk or very spicy, but i just have constipation the next day and if it's really bad diarrhea once

I Initially didn't want to take biologics cos of the side effect and am still a bit jittery about them.
I also have a brother who had it 10 years ago as a minor one in his stomach and was recently diagnosed as having no inflammation or symptoms without taking the biologics. My biggest inspiration to solve this without taking it.

I started considering biologics recently as I wanted to get into a healthy lifestyle instead of just sitting around all day.

I wonder if it would maybe it would help manage and reduce my Crohn's while also helping me get in shape (skinny fat body type)

I've been wanting to eat more types of healthy, nutritious food to gain weight like sizable quantities of chicken, rice, maybe avocado and nut butters but currently can only take a few of it before getting bloated or constipated because I try to eat big portions to bulk. I thought maybe biologics would help me eat as if I had no Crohn's and would allow to to bulk. I still intend to eat healthy food though




TLDR: CROHNS IS OK, BARELY NOTICABLE. NEVER TAKEN BILOGICS BEFORE BECAUSE OF SIDE EFFECTS AND ALSO COS HAD A BROTHER WHO MANAGED TO BE DECLARED ASYMPTOMATIC AND INFLAMMATION FREE AFTER 10 YEARS WITHOUT BIOLOGICS. WANT TO START LIVING HEALTHY BY GETTING INTO BODYWEIGHT TRAINING AND EATING HEALTHY (ALSO TO GET IN SHAPE) AND AM THINKING OF BIOLOGICS (HUMIRA) TO ALLOW ME TO EAT BIGGER PORTIONS WITHOUT BLOATING OR CONSTIPATING.




HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS: 

1) Should I take the biologics (Humira)? ,are they reccomended for my severity of Crohn's?, What are some bad side effects?  are they worth it? 

2) If I do take it, is it a life long thing? or say if it gets better after 6 months/1yr, may I come off it? Will there be any side effects if I do stop taking it? - anyone who has experience of temporary biologic use do answer.

3) Is keeping a healthy lifestyle alone, good enuf to manage Crohn's or are the biologics pretty much unavoidable? - (I have a brother who had it 10 years ago and was recently diagnosed as having no inflammation or symptoms without taking the biologics.) Looking for anybody with experience on this?

4) Anybody who has gotten into shape with Crohn's - Did you use biologics or nah? Did they help you eat better? Has keeping the lifestyle alone managed your Crohn's? Or do you need the biologics?",2025-03-30 15:55:51,CrohnsDisease,3,1jnfi8p,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jnfi8p/should_i_take_biologics_humira/,2025-03-30

121,Humira,"insurance stopped covering Humira, offered Hadlima - but apparently only the citrate version?","Hi all,

  
I have been taking Humira auto-injector pen for Chron's and hidradentritis supprativa for several years now. i have had almost no issues. January this year, I received a letter that my insurance no longer covers Humira. my doctor said they would submit a prior authorization for me to try and get it approved. After a couple weeks, that was denied, saying I had to try Hadlima for six months, and only if I was allergic/it had horrible complications/ etc they would consider switching me back.

I had a lot of concerns about the copay since my deductible is very high, and the Humira reimbursement program basically eliminated that for me, but I could manage that.

But, today I got a letter in the mail DENYING my doctor's prior authorization request for Hadlima 40MG/0.4mL. Apparently, they would only allow me to try Hadlima 40MG/0.8mL, and THEN after 6 months they would consider letting me switch to a different medication.

i had no idea why they would care about the amount of liquid in the dose so I looked it up a bit, and it seems that possibly the Hadlima 0.8mL is not citrate free like the 0.4mL, or like Humira. i have heard that Humira was painful before they got rid of the citrate, and read similar things about Hadlima..

  
I don't really know what I am asking here, I'm just a bit scared. I already am frequently a few days late for my Humira dose because I hate doing the shots, and if pain is involved, it will surely be worse! does anyone have any experience with specifically Hadlima 40MG/0.8mL? does it hurt worse than Humira?

 also, does anyone know if there is a reimbursement program or something similar for Hadlima?

 or if anyone has any other advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

  
sorry if this is rambling, I'm just very nervous at the moment. thanks in advance everyone!

122,Humira,Calprotectin and medication questions,"My 12yo son was diagnosed with Crohn’s last year. At the time he was quite sick and his  calprotectin was 7100. His doctor put him on a steroid while we waited for insurance to approve inflectra. After starting inflectra and then raising the dose, he felt so much better. He gained weight, grew, was less fatigued, etc. Labs improved with that and iron infusions. We just learned he’s building antibodies to the inflectra and it’s essentially running out too fast. Since his symptoms had improved on it, we opted to try sticking with inflectra but adding methotrexate and folic acid. He had some weird reactions, including numbness that came and went in his arms and legs and hot/cold flashes. These went away after discontinuing the folic acid. For two days after taking the methotrexate, he had extreme fatigue and nausea that kept him home from school. His calprotectin yesterday was 400 which is way better than last spring but still not great. We’re now looking at switching to Humira but trying the methotrexate once more just to see if the symptoms were the drug, Crohn’s being weird and active, or something else. Our pediatric GI is the absolute best and quick to answer all of my questions, etc. but I also definitely value the various experiences and perspectives of the Crohn’s community. That said, 1) Has anyone ever experienced any reactions like that to those drugs? 2) Has anyone developed antibodies to a biologic and had success with another? Did you need methotrexate with it to work? 3) Is normal calprotectin even achievable or am I hoping for something that won’t ever exist for my son?

I'm 28 and i was diagnosed with crohns 2 years ago and only recently have been cleared for no signs of inflammation after colonoscopy on humira. It took a long time of pain and fighting back and forth with insurance with denials to get to this point. I'm on medicaid/medi-cal and receiving treatment from a crohns specialist within UCLA. Normally, I wouldn't even be able to receive care from a GI doctor within this network from most insurance so I'm grateful for it. The problem is that I really need to be able to start earning and that would mean losing medi-cal. I've messed up my life even before my diagnosis so I only have a general bachelors degree for business and basically 0 work experience up until now.



I would most likely have to go find insurance on the ACA marketplace but all these plans are extremely expensive, in the sense that the deductible/max out of pocket is in the 8-9k range which I would hit every year and most likely wouldn't be able to afford. I would most likely have to switch to an alternative biosimilar to humira, where the payment assistance program would be able to cover maybe 1-2 doses at most and I would have to pay for the rest to hit max OOP per year. I would also lose my doctor, because UCLA isn't in network with most insurances and I would have to most likely go through the entire pre-authorization process again. Just thinking about how many things would go wrong is beyond stressful and that's not even counting trying to find a job would be like. Do I just have to accept that there's no good option and to just start over again?



This is most likely an issue with people in the US because the healthcare system is so backwards, but if there's anyone who has been in a similar situation I would love to receive any sort of advice.

124,Humira,"Need advice: on Rinvoq, always sick and no energy","TLDR: Rinvoq since October 2024. Been sick on and off since then. No energy. Any advice or same experiences? 

I started taking Rinvoq in October 2024. 12 weeks of 45mg. Now on 30mg. It’s the first medication that works. Already had stelara and humira and both did nothing. Calprotectine stayed &gt;900. When taking Rinvoq it is below 250. Only problem is the fact that I’m sick all the time. Already had to take antibiotics on 4 occasions since beginning of December. It all started with a cough a week or two after starting Rinvoq. By end of November I had serious chest pain from all the coughing. Got prescribed antibiotics because i had a lung infection. Never got really better. I have at max one “good” week and then I’m sick again. I don’t have any energy to do anything. And by now I’m losing hope it will ever get better. 

I get that the medication is not good for my immune system but I’m wondering if this is my future? I have two little kids that take all kind of bacteria/viruses home from daycare so I probably get sick sometimes because of them but I don’t see a solution for that. 

Stopping Rinvoq is not really an option, says my doctor, because it’s the only medication that works.

My question is- did anyone else experience more side effects with Amjevita? I have had headaches and nausea every single day along with some vomiting that I have not experienced before.

127,Humira,Adalimumab and pregnancy,"Hello all,

My wife has ulcerative colitis which has now progressed to the point where we are considering different medical treatments. However, we are also considering starting a family in the near future. I understand that having the disease in remission is the number one priority, but we have been given some different options for this. One of the options is to start taking Adalimumab (also called Humira).

The other option is a steroid treatment for a few months before pregnancy, which would mean not taking anything during the pregnancy but it also appears like the steroids will be much rougher on her than the Adalimumab. Steroid use also cannot help if there is a flare up during the pregnancy. 

My wife is very nervous about taking any treatments throughout her pregnancy and we're trying to find all the information we can before making a decision. Has anyone here got experience of taking Adalimumab during their pregnancy that they could share?

128,Humira,Finally Diagnosed - Fear of Stricture and Humira,"After years of back and forth, I have finally been diagnosed with both Crohns and Spondyloarthritis. I feel both relieved and heartbroken at the same time. But at least I have answers now. I have a CTE on Friday and I am nervous they will find a stricture (based on a 6 months flare up that has led me to be unable to use the restroom or pass gas consistently). 

For those who have had strictures, does it normally result in a surgery? I've had so many surgeries and I do not want to go back into the OR. If you had a surgery, did you end up with a colostomy?

For those who have Spondyloarthritis, does it also impact your hands and feet? My large joints are effected but my hands and feet have started hurting over the last year. They at first thought I had RA but now it has officially been changed to Spondyloarthritis. My SI joints are severely damaged.

I have also been put on Humira and short-term prednisone. Any advice or experience would be great. This is the first time I have ever been on a medication like that (Humira). 

I wish I wasn't on this subreddit but I am glad I found a place that offers support. If anyone can share their experience with Crohns, Spondyloarthritis or Humira, I'd greatly appreciate it.

129,Humira,Normal Labs yet in a flare," 
I was diagnosed with Crohn's about 9 years ago it took 6 years to figure out what was wrong with me because my labs were always healthy and normal. I haven't given it much thought over the past 7 years because I was in remission, now that Humira stopped working  I'm frustrated with this problem again. I've been in a flare with constant diarrhea and bloody stools for over two months. I keep getting labs both blood and stool every result is ""normal"" and ""healthy"" with no signs of a flare. Even though half of the stool sample I provided was pure blood. I just don't understand why my labs don't reflect my health. The only thing that diagnosed me in the first place was a colonoscopy. 

I'm curious if anyone else had experience with this or could give me insight into why this is always my case.

We'll be starting skyrizzy soon once insurance is taken care of and I can schedule my first infusion. Well I know it's a different class of biologics given how my fatigue increased I'm worried that my fatigue will get worse on this medication as well. It's already quite debilitating unmedicated and causes me to fall behind work. When I was on humira it was even worse and all around it severely infecting my personal life.

131,Humira,Looking for General Advice on Crohn’s—Long Hospital Stay &amp; Surgery Recovery,"Hey everyone,

I’m 19 and have been dealing with Crohn’s since I was 13. In that time, I’ve been through Humira, Remicade, and Stelara—none of which have worked for me. I think my doctors are planning to put me on Skyrizi next, but at this point, I feel exhausted and discouraged.

I’ve been in the hospital since January 3rd because I kept getting blockages and developed a nasty abscess. It got bad enough that I had to undergo resection surgery, and now I’m in the recovery phase. It’s been a long, draining process, both physically and mentally.

To make things even harder, my parents don’t really understand what I’m going through. My dad keeps suggesting random holistic remedies, not realizing that Crohn’s isn’t the same for everyone. I get that some of these things might work for others, but they could also be harmful to me. Instead of listening to me or my doctors, my parents act like I’m just being defiant and not valuing their advice. It’s frustrating because I already feel so out of control with my own health, and this just adds to it.

I guess I’m just looking for advice from people who understand. How do you cope when treatments keep failing? How do you deal with family members who don’t really get it? And if anyone has experience with Skyrizi, how has it worked for you?

I’d really appreciate any insight. Thanks in advance.",2025-02-24 04:28:16,CrohnsDisease,2,1iwtnlg,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1iwtnlg/looking_for_general_advice_on_crohnslong_hospital/,2025-02-24
132,Humira,C-section or vaginal delivery with crohns?,"For those have previously given birth with crohns, has your doctor recommended c-section over vaginal delivery? If so, where was your disease located? Has anyone given birth while having internal hemorrhoids?

I just found out im pregnant (after getting the OK from GI). I've been in clinical remission for over 6 months thanks to humira. Last big flare was a year ago with severe inflammation/penetrating disease/phlegmons in the terminal ileum. Before that, past flares have involved severe proctitis. I currently have lingering internal prolapsed hemorrhoids and mild rectal irritation. It seems like abdominal surgery would want to be avoided with the TI issues, but also worry about the hemorrhoids with a vaginal delivery. 

Obviously I plan to ask my GI these questions at next appointment but would really appreciate anyones past experiences in similar situations in the meantime! 

Thanks!

133,Humira,Erythema Nodosum &amp; Arthritis,"Hello -

I'm 36F and was diagnosed with Crohn's 9 years ago. It was mild when we caught it, thankfully. I also have hidradenitis suppurativa. I've been on Humira for about 7 years and was in remission for a very long time.

About a year ago I fell into a really depressive episode and stopped taking my Humira. It was a mix of not wanting to take care of myself and then feeling shame about missing doses. Luckily I have a good support system and found a new therapist and am doing much better! I have been back on my Humira since August. I was off for a few months.

I've already beat myself up a lot about what a stupid decision that was, so please no comments about that. Depression is an asshole.

Anyway - last year at the end of June I noticed red bumps on my leg. I bounced around between GI and derm. I had a biopsy in July and it was confirmed to be erythema eodosum. I did a month of prednisone. My last week of the taper the spots came back, so I was put on 3 more weeks. I was also back on Humira now. A few weeks later, the spots came back again. I reached out to my GI again. He said since my Crohn's was in remission GI wise, it wasn't related. My last scope was in 2020, so this was based on CRP and fecal calprotectin. 

My PCP did a bunch of blood tests. Positive ANA (which I've had before). All the other rheum stuff was negative. I was sent to the HS clinic at derm because they thought they somehow might be related. They said they can't really tell me why it happens. At this point, it is mid-January. I've had EN since late June. They wanted to put me on hydroxychloroquine, but that is a no-no with Lexapro, so they started me on Colchicine. I've also been having knee, ankle, and low back pain. They ordered some xrays and referred me to rheumatology.

Rheum sent me for an ultrasound of knees and ankles. Said the EN was likely Crohn's related. My knee ultrasound showed: Small, anterior joint effusion, bilaterally; Mild quadriceps tendinosis with small enthesophyte formation at the insertion, bilaterally; and a small Baker cyst on my right knee. Small effusion on my ankle. Back xray showed Minimal bilateral subchondral sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints, favored to be mechanical.

Because there was no active inflammation shown in my joints, rheum said it was most likely wear &amp; tear. She maybe I had a small flare last year and that caused the EN. She did not recommend any changes to my treatment. Said pain in my knees is osteoarthritis and bone spurs. 

I really like my GI, but I wonder if he was out of his depths. He was not on the IBD team. He is leaving in March so I have an appointment for someone on the IBD team so I have a doc, but that isn't until July.

Is it normal for EN to last for almost 8 months? I'm finally seeing the spots go down with the new meds. It is making me feel like they think I want to be sick and am overreacting. It just seems weird to me to have a diagnosis of Crohn's, have EN, and arthritis symptoms and it's just ""meh, wear and tear, you're getting older"". 

  
This ended up being WAY longer than I meant. Clearly I needed to vent. Does anyone have experience like this? If it really is just osteoarthritis, fine, but I feel like they should have investigated more. Am I overreacting or should I push for more?",2025-02-20 22:29:18,CrohnsDisease,3,1iubcxo,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1iubcxo/erythema_nodosum_arthritis/,2025-02-20
134,Humira,Looking for advice - debating Hartmanns Pouch Removal,"I’ve been living with a ileostomy for a decade now after insurance denied hartmanns reversal. I’ve come to terms with life with a stoma and honestly it was better than dealing with constant pain and flare ups.

The problem? Over the last year, my hartmanns pouch has been flaring up badly with lots of inflammation and pain. I have tried many medications in the past year including stellara, and rinvoq. Prior to my initial ileostomy, I had previously tried cimzia , methotrexate, remicade, mesalamine, 6MP, humira but none of them worked, hence the surgery. 

My doctors have started to discuss removal of the pouch with me and I’m not sure. Part of me wants to get it over with and avoid future issues but part of me worries that it might mean that inflammation will reappear in another part of the gut. 

Any one has been in a similar situation and had their pouch removed? Was it worth it? How was the recovery? Do you wish you had waited or did it bring relief?

135,Humira,F*ckn Insurance requiring I switch from Humira to Amjevita,"Basically the title says it all. I've been in remission on Humira for 13 years. My employer PPO switched us all from Anthem to Blue Shield of CA as of January 1st. Now they are denying my Prior Authorization for Humira and my doctor is saying this is a battle they have been losing with multiple patients this year.

  
I called Humira and they said they can't do anything since my insurance is willing to cover a biosimilar.

1. Anyone had this experience and had any luck with getting their insurance to stop being idiots and continue to cover Humira?

Little background: diagnosed 16ish years ago.

I’m a Crohn’s patient of 20 years, and had a 10 inch resection done about 15 years ago along the end of the ileum and beginning of the colon. Had been managing with Humira for the most part and was caught off guard by this most recent experience and was just looking for anyone who went through similar.

I was admitted to the hospital on January 27th when I woke up to suddenly going to the bathroom passing large amounts of blood. Turns out the anastomosis site from before had ulcerated into an arterial vessel and I ended up requiring an emergency embolization and about 3.5 liters of blood transfusion. The treating hospital had a surgeon see me who said that it would be a good idea to resect that section now as the embolization they did was a life saving measure and not a guarantee the site wouldn’t continue to deteriorate. I agreed, and 3 days after on January 30th I went in to have another 6 inches removed.

I had some complications with what felt like a bowel obstruction after the surgery and wasn’t really able to resume solid food until about 2 days ago. I was discharged today. I feel so spent and tired between 11 days at the hospital, the pain and discomfort of the days following the surgery. I was so excited to be home, but I am so weak and exhausted. Weirdly now, I am tolerating food incredibly well today and am hoping this is a sign things are on the mend, but I was just looking to see if anyone had any experiences they could share just to help me get through this.

143,Humira,"Frustrated, depressed, and seeking advice/similar experiences (Weird/Interesting medical history)","As in the title, I am deeply frustrated with my care/treatment and am feeling slightly depressed because I feel my body hates itself. I'm going to layout my medical history and conditions but would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar to what I have. Also if anyone has advice, I'd appreciate any help or words of encouragement. I am also typing this out because I will be submitting my case to different hospitals and I will be using this body of text along with medical records.

  
**Current Conditions:**

* Non-ocular Stickler Syndrome Type 3 (Genetic connective tissue disorder)
   * I have had this since birth but this has only been really studied in the last 15 years and wasn't diagnosed with it until my early 20s.
* High Blood Pressure
   * I have had high blood pressure since I was 14, tested extensively, and one of the best doctors (Cardiologist) I have ever seen concluded the cause is most likely neurological. I am currently on medication to control this.
* Crohn's Disease?
   * I will get into this in my explanation near the bottom of the post. I think my medical history and timeline of when things happened is very important relating to what may have caused and is causing this disease in me. 

  
**Past Conditions:**

* Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
   * This resulted from a severe concussion at 14 in high school football. There is a lot of history with this but this injury resulted in the following issues.
* Occipital Neuralgia (Chronic head pain related to inflamed nerves)
   * Inflammation of the occipital nerves in the back of the head. This caused chronic pain for nearly a decade in the form of a never ending migraine. This head pain skyrocketed my blood pressure to critical levels and landed me in the ER many times. The highest blood pressure reading I got when I dealt with this pain was 320/190.. the firefighter told me I should've been stroking out.
* Severe Depression
   * This is difficult for me to talk about because I tried to unalive myself many times. I have overcome this state twice in my life. The first time was because of a side effect to the medicine Gabapentin. I was on Gabapentin because near the end of my severe concussion my brain was healing but misfiring nerve signals, causing my legs to go numb. The second time was due to the chronic pain and changes in blood pressure medication. I couldn't see a way out of the chronic pain and the one escape I started to see was ending my life.

  
*This is only a brief summary of my conditions. I'm going to layout the timeline because I think it is very important in how certain conditions manifested/started.* 



**Timeline:**

Going back to winter of 2011 and spring of 2012 I received an injury from wrestling that pulled muscles and potentially affected my nerves in my neck. I was treated by a crappy doctor that pushed opioids and made the issue worse. My parents had me stop seeing that doctor and instead brought me to a chiropractor who ""fixed"" this issue in about 2 weeks. Because of the crappy doctor I missed the entire wrestling season my 8th grade year. 



In the early summer of 2012 I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at 14 years old. I underwent testing but nothing else was found to be wrong. My primary at the time wrote it off as hormonal and that I should grow out of it. My high blood pressure was soon put on the backburner when later that summer I got a severe concussion from a high school football practice. This concussion was so severe it was a TBI and lasted 4 months before my brain was ""healing"". I say ""healing"" because in hindsight my concussion was not treated how it should've been and it was misfiring nerve signals causing my legs to go numb. I was put on Gabapentin which gave feeling back to my legs but upon stopping the medication I became severely depressed.

  
I don't plan on talking about my severe depression much because I don't like remembering those memories but I tried to commit many times. I was actually put in outpatient care and was put on suicide watch at school. (Freshman year was awful). I eventually overcame this through immense effort and self reflection. Trying to live in the now rather than focus on the past or future. Living for others that loved me even though I didn't love myself. Shortly after overcoming this I developed intense headaches that never ceased and only varied in intensity. This persisted most of my Sophomore year of high school until getting nerve blocking injections all around my head. This miraculously stopped the pain and my junior and senior year of high school I got to experience being healthy and being a normal teenager. I certainly made up for lost time.

  
In 2016 I started my first semester as a freshman of Purdue University. I had a couple accidents where in about 2 weeks I had hit my head multiple times. The pain came back. I was unsure if it was the same pain or a new concussion. It could've been both but I didn't have a good baseline. During this time is when I hit my all time high for blood pressure (320/190) because head pain increases your blood pressure and high blood pressure can increase head pain. This is when I took medical leave from Purdue and started seeing a new neurologist. This neurologist was the worst doctor I have ever had as he misdiagnosed me with an inoperable brain tumor. I did a spinal tap just to find out it was not cancerous. This is when my parents and I decided to get a second opinion and went to Mayo Clinic.

  
At Mayo Clinic they found I never had a tumor and that the pain was most likely nerve related and caused by the TBI. They did psychological testing to show this was not being made up as some have accused me of. They then tried many medicines and treatments but nothing worked. I eventually left this doctor and started learning how to function so I could return to school and get my degree, which I did. During my years of college I had another period of severe depression when I didn't see an end to the pain and underwent changes to blood pressure medication. This is also when I saw one of the best doctors I have ever seen who was the head of Cardiology of Riley's Children Hospital at the time. After exhausting extensive testing including Stickler Syndrome related issues and other specialists including kidney, he concluded this was beyond his expertise and that it was most likely neurological. At this point my blood pressure was under control. Before graduating a doctor at an ER thought my pain was Occipital Neuralgia and was shortly diagnosed with that condition not long after. A treatment I found that helped the pain was Cranial Sacral Massage Therapy. Cannabis/hemp was also one of the only things that actually took my pain away even though it was short term and didn't always take it away completely. I eventually got my bachelor's degree from Purdue University after years of pain in 2022. 

  
My Occipital Neuralgia and High Blood Pressure continued to be an issue until December of 2023. I found a place called NeuroHealth where they used newer therapies including eye coordination movements, red laser therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, chiropractic, and a Gyrostim machine. This was intensive brain therapy but the most helpful things were the combination of the red laser therapy shown at the base of my skull on the back of my head while shocking my vagus nerve to reset my nervous system. My chronic pain which I had dealt with for nearly 8 years straight and was told it would last the rest of my life, was gone in 2 days. This brain therapy was a week long from 7am to 4pm every day. My pain came back once but after being seen one more time, the pain has stayed gone.

  
***This is where my Crohn's? issues starts...***

  
Following the Intensive Brain Therapy in December of 2023 I stopped taking Amitriptyline. This medication was mostly for my head and slightly for my mental health. In February of 2024 I started to have stomach issues shortly after starting my new job at a bank. At first I thought it was a stomach bug but then it persisted. I was tested for infections, bacteria, etc. but nothing was coming back. Finally I saw a GI and pushed for a colonoscopy &amp; endoscopy. The double probe was done and the GI found mild inflammation in the colon. He suspected Crohn's so he put me on a modified diet and did a fecal sample. He still thought I might have IBS and not Crohn's. He started by putting me back on Amitriptyline citing it being a traditional approach to treating gut issues. It did nothing.



My GI then wanted me to go on an 8 week Prednisone taper stating that if this helped me I had Crohn's and would then be put on a biologic. The taper helped significantly, I was able to DoorDash more and more. I was working up to manage full time hours so I could know when I would be able to handle a career again. I got Covid and Bronchitis during this time but the bathroom trips and stomach pain started to ease. Shortly after finishing the Prednisone taper I was approved for Humira.

  
I took my first dose of Humira January 2nd of 2025 and had a rare side effect reaction. I became extremely fatigued (sleeping 12 hours a day) and my arms and legs have a pulsing feeling where they feel extremely weak and numb. I have seen my primary, gone to the ER, and seen my GI. The ER neurologist was concerned about demyelinating disease where the protective coating around the nerves is damaged. I was told these feelings would go away when Humira was out of my system. It is currently 1/27/2025 and these symptoms have not eased or gone away. They have remained consistent.

  
I just saw my GI's assistant, not sure why the GI didn't see me after having the reaction to Humira. I am not allowed to take Humira anymore and I had to push to test how much is still in my system. If Humira is out of my system then how bad did it mess me up to still feel this way? If it is not out of my system then maybe these symptoms will go away when it is finally gone. I also pushed for a nutrition panel to see where my vitamin levels are and will be doing another calprotectin fecal sample within the next month. I have no medication to treat Crohn's and after a year my GI has flipped his view 3 times now saying it might or might not be Crohn's even after diagnosing me with it...

  
I have had my fair share of bad doctors and this guy feels like one of them. The constant flipping for whether I have Crohn's or not after a year seems ridiculous to me. I'll list my symptoms below and would like feedback on if this really does sound like Crohn's or not. I feel like my GI is ignoring my medical history and doesn't answer my questions. 

  
**Current Symptoms:**

* Stomach pain where the small intestines are
   * I had inflammation/pain in my stomach as well but that has gone away mostly after the Prednisone Taper.
* Weight loss
   * Before the Prednisone Taper I lost enough to be declared anemic and malnourished. Gained a lot back with increased appetite from the steroid but am losing weight again since being off of it and Humira.
* Extra-intestinal inflammation
   * This is completely random but the spot it keeps happening is right above my right eye. It inflames to the point where it forces my right eye shut and I have to take Benadryl to make it stop. My mom told me my entire right side of the face was swollen one of those times. This seems to happen more frequently when I've been sick. (I have pictures of the eye inflammation I can try attaching if requested). I've been told possible allergic reaction but again it's random and nothing is introduced to react to.
* Frequent bathroom trips
   * I have good days and bad days, my diet is super bland but I spend hours in the bathroom everyday. I got 4-5 times a day on average right now.
* Fatigue
   * Since taking Humira, my fatigue has become extreme.
* Numbness/Weakness in arms and legs
   * Timing suggests this was also a rare side effect to Humira.

  
**My personal theory:**

I think I have central nervous system dysfunction that is causing my High Blood Pressure and digestive issues whether it is Crohn's or not. Specifically the Vagus nerve since it regulates the cardiovascular and digestive systems in the body. 

  
Other theories include having this issue for far longer but the Amitriptyline I was one hid it or kept it at bay. There is a correlation between multiple Covid infections and the onset of autoimmune issues. There is also the possibility of some genetic cause or malnutrition/malabsorption. 

  
I personally do not think it is coincidence that I had Vagus nerve stimulation only to develop these issues a few weeks after. I think Humira affecting my nervous system may be related. I could be wrong but I am advocating for myself and it logically makes sense given my history.



\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Overall, I would like feedback. Has anyone else had similar or the same experiences in terms of conditions, symptoms, side effects, experiences with doctors, etc. What advice do you have in general? I am currently unable to work and am struggling to function normally despite my GI saying, ""if it is Crohn's, it's mild"" like it makes my quality of life seem less awful. I have said that if this is mild then I'd hate to see moderate/severe. I don't even want to get started on this GI brushing off my concerns about depression and then putting me on medication that has negatively impacted my mental health.

  
I am stuck. Any advice is appreciated but if anyone has been through similar I would appreciate knowing I'm not alone. I've been a weird medical case for over a decade and it seems to keep getting weirder. I'm at the point where I wouldn't mind being placed in a lab and studied to figure it all out. I am grateful for this subreddit as I have never had a support group and have been trying to read advice and stories as I navigate my diagnosis this past year.",2025-01-27 20:33:28,CrohnsDisease,0,1ibja22,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ibja22/frustrated_depressed_and_seeking_advicesimilar/,2025-01-27
144,Humira,I've had Crohns/UC for 10 Years and I Need Help,"Hey everyone! This is my first post here because I am not sure where else to turn for some advice, and recommendations from individuals who struggle with the same disease. I am a 24 y/o F, and for the past four years I have been battling to keep my disease in remission with little or no success. I have been hospitalized 6 or 7 times in the last four years, with the worst case being a bowel obstruction. A part of my colon was almost removed twice, and I had antibiotics to recover from appendicitis twice as well. I have had an anal fistula surgery when I was younger, and I have some strictures in my GI tract from damage in the past. My ESR number has fluctuated from 7 all the way to 89 and even higher, and my calprotectin has seen the 1500+ markers.

Trying to keep this as short as possible - but at the end of 2023 I thought my fight was over when I was finally swapped to Rinvoq 15mg x3 (45mg dose) tablets per day. Rinvoq worked incredible for this past year of 2024. I was going on runs again outside, lifting heavier weights than I ever had before at the gym, enjoying green tea and the occasional coffee again (never alcohol or smoking). I was even able to re-introduce simple or blended fruits and vegetables back into my diet. I didn't feel scared anymore of eating one wrong food item and ending up back in urgent care or worse for a stay.

For some reason even though there has been no dietary changes, no alcohol, no smoking, no high fiber foods (everything you are NOT supposed to do with our disease), I am experiencing a flare up again that has been ongoing since mid december 2024, until now as I type this. My ESR number is shooting back up into the 40's again, calprotectin above 1200, and I had to go to the ER where I was prescribed prednisone and now budesonide steroids at a 40mg dosage per day. Worst of all, I had another CT scan done that shows ""a 7cm length stricture of the distal ileum and terminal ileum with acute hyperenhancement,"" and ""another 2cm length shorter segment stricture of the distal ileal loops noted slightly to the left of the midline."" I can feel these when I try going to the gym or working out and it has halted my progress for now trying to do anything high intensity.

For full context, I have failed; **Remicade, Humira, Stelara, Entyvio** (entyvio I only gave 3 months - my diet was reduced to plain rice and chicken and I felt nothing on entyvio) and **now \*potentially\* rinvoq**. At this point, I'm at a bit of a loss on what to even do. I continue to work with my doctor, and there is a potential she will want to switch me to Skyrizi soon, but we haven't discussed the CT scan results. Even then, for four years now I have been living with these strictures around my colon and they have genuinely degraded the quality of my life by so much. I like to think that this disease has made me a stronger person because of what I have had to endure, but at what point is it worth it to remove sections of my colon to improve my quality of life? Does anyone have any experience with something similar to this, failing medications, or any general advice?

I would love to get into more details of my full diet and supplement routine I was taking while Rinvoq was working amazingly, but I don't want to make this post too long. I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this far. I have been in a big mental slump recently just wondering when the pain will end and what I might be doing wrong. If anyone has any home remedies, or recommendations for the healing of the strictures as well please let me know!

145,Humira,My first biologic ,"Hi everybody 
Today I officially started my first biologic !

They started me with Humira and as it was my first time they gave me 4 shots .

When they told me that I needed 4 pens I thought they meant 1 shot with 4x dose .

Oh boy I was wrong .

They poked me 4 times , I should have expected it.

They made me take the last shot by myself and as soon as it was over I felt lightheaded and dizzy and I had to lay down , but after 10 minutes I was totally ok .

I really hope this will give me some sort of relieve from the pain and from the brown .

What is your experience with this medication ? 

I was quite shocked about the side effects that they told me (including a major risk of getting cancer WTH).

Please tell me it’s gonna be ok ",2025-01-21 13:43:45,CrohnsDisease,10,1i6iv07,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1i6iv07/my_first_biologic/,2025-01-21

148,Humira,Crohn’s and Ozempic,"Just wanted to share that this has been a positive experience three weeks in. 

A little background - I have been suffering horribly this year with the loss of my father who was a type I diabetic in addition to my Crohn’s disease. I as hospitalized for a lot of June 2024 and finally started taking Humira in November. I felt a strange connection to my father as I injected my dose twice a month… started to gain back the 30 pounds I lost, felt depressed and lost and then saw that ozempic curbs the sweet cravings and horrible foods that make my symptoms worse. 
Started on Ozempic three weeks ago and now after getting used to it feel like I am a lot better at taking care of my nutrition needs. And oddly enjoy the shots as they remind me of my father taking care of his diabetes.

149,Humira,Biologics with best Co-pay or self reimbursement plans?,"As is the case with most of you, my insurance is dropping Humira and recommending Hadlima or Amjevita.  

I was all on board with Amjevita until I found out their max out of pocket payment for both co pay and self-reimbursement programs is $3000.  I just renewed my insurance to a $7000 max out of pocket deductible which means I should still be on the line for $4,000 after Amjevita maxes out their copay program.

Does anyone have any first hand experience with this or Hadlima's plan?

151,Humira,IBX drops humira - who else is getting screwed by this?,"Hi- Looking to see if anyone else is having the same experience.

* On Humira for 8+ years, with IBX insurance. Between coverage +copay assistance through abbvie copay is $0-5/month
* Get notified IBX is dropping humira for 2025 in favor of generic adulimumab [(for ""affordability for patients!"" per their press release)](https://provcomm.ibx.com/pnc-ibc/news/Pages/Biosimilars-An-opportunity-to-reduce-prescription-costs-for-patients.aspx)
* For some reason, can't even fill new RX through IBX's PBM specialty pharmacy optum and have to use performspecialty [(where you can't even order online)](https://provcomm.ibx.com/pnc-ibc/news/Pages/New-prescriptions-required-for-patients-on-Humira-adalimumab-or-adalimumab-biosimilars.aspx)
* Copay assistance for the generic drug caps at $200/mo so the new copay is $419/mo

So in summary going from \~$30 out of pocket/annually for a critical medication, to \~$5000 out of pocket/annually for the GENERIC VERSION OF THE SAME MEDICATION. What a joke!

Can't be the only one in this situation given the numerous indications for Humira. If you have a similar story comment or DM me your email/old copay/new copay.

152,Humira,I'm Running Out of Medications to Try and I'm Frustrated. Can Anyone Relate?,"I was diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease back in January 2017. I've been in various degrees of flaring since my diagnosis, and last week I finally had to admit that Stelara was not working for me after reviewing my inflammation markers and disease activity with my GI. This is the 5th medication that I've tried. So far, I've been on Mezavant, Imurin, Humira, Remicade and finally Stelara.

I feel like I'm irritable all the time from the constant pain, I've been trying to stick to a low residue diet to help manage my symptoms and have several loved ones who are convinced I just need to eat better to get relief, that I'm being picky and the odd slice of whole wheat toast won't kill me.

We're going to try Skyrizi next - if it doesn't work there's only one other medication left available to me that's approved for Crohn's in my country (Rinvoq). My GI is hesitant to prescribe it as he's seen two IBD patients on this medication require emergency surgery after bowel perforations.

I just want to experience this mythical state of remission, anyone else? I have an Aunt who has UC and does better off medications, and I'm so jealous.

Back story - I've had Crohn's since I was about 12 yro, have had flares here and there across my life, did many years on Humira and the last 10 on Stelara. The stelara has had me pretty healthy for the last 5 years. With a severe restriction in my large over the years, the decision was made to do a small resection to remove this. Upon surgery, the realization was made that my large intestine was much worse than imaging showed. The decision was made to remove. 

Looking at the situation post-surgery, I'm glad it was done. The intestine was very unhealthy and was pretty much a ticking medical situation. I'm healthy and the colectomy has taken well.

157,Humira,Biologic Initiation during pregnancy ,"Pregnant and desperate PLEASE let me know if you have ANY input: I have been on Remicade for well over 10 years. Within the last few months I developed a rash which was ultimately determined to be drug induced folliculitis associated with Remicade, and severe enough that doctors are concurring that I should stop Remicade. 

My GI doctor is out due to surgery for a couple of weeks, but I got a message from her prior to her absence saying she discussed my case with dermatology and is in agreement that the Remicade should be stopped. She mentioned trying to get auth for Skyrizi. 

I am extremely hesitant to start Skyrizi while pregnant. After researching further, I thought maybe Stelara would be a better option, but after looking into it a little bit more I am really not feeling good about starting a new biologic at all during pregnancy. I can't find any recommendations on starting a new biologic mid-pregnancy, and am just not comfortable not knowing how I will even respond to a new drug. I also have not recovered from the Remicade induced folliculitis - in fact it is still getting worse even 6 weeks after my last infusion. 

Baby is due in 5 months and I have not had a flare since before my bowel resection that was done almost a year before starting Remicade (surgery was in 2011, started Remicade in 2012).  If it adds any context, I also had a severe allergic reaction to azathioprine in 2011 between surgery and starting Remicade that landed me unconscious in the ICU, and prior to surgery my Crohn's disease did not respond to Humira. 

Please let me know if you have any experience that might help me in any way as there is extremely limited data available. Anyone who has any information about starting, switching or discontinuing a biologic while pregnant would be invaluable to me right now. Also, any experience with drug induced folliculitis at all would be helpful. Really, anyone who has experienced even the smallest piece of the puzzle that I am currently experiencing would help.

162,Humira,"Failing Humira, doc wants me to try Stelara. ","I’m having increasing local reactions with every Humira injection and my doctor wants me to switch to Stelara. The doctor’s office is concerned that my insurance company isn’t going to want to switch to that medication and would likely want me to try something like Remicade first. I have no interest in doing that, especially considering that my doctor is suggesting a different medication and because Remicade is the same type of medication as Humira. 

Does anyone have any experience making this switch or switching to Stelara? Any advice on dealing with insurance companies in the US? I have BCBS and in general I’m very pleased with my benefits and experience, but I want to go into this conversation with the insurance company prepared.

163,Humira,How did you get “cleared” to become pregnant?,"Hi everyone, 

A little backstory: I was diagnosed with CD in July 2024. Up until June 2024 my husband and I were TTC. I went on Humira end of August 2024; so I’ve been on the biologic for almost 4 months now.

Since starting the biologic I have had normal stools (was having diarrhea before) and little to no pain (joint or abdominal). In November we found out my husband is unable to produce sperm so we are looking into the donor route. I’m currently going through all the testing at the fertility clinic to make sure I am good to go for either IUI or IVF.

So far everything seems okay and normal. However, last week, I got a random pain in my stomach so bad I couldn’t even stand straight. It was the first time I had pain like this since starting humira. It went away thankfully in about an hour. But now I’m scared about getting the OK from my GI at my follow up appt on Jan 2 with TTC.

My question is (since this is all new to me):

1. How do you know you’re in remission? And can you be in remission and still have a random pain like that? Or is it always a sign that you’re not “healing” inside?

2. How do you get “cleared” to get pregnant? I know it may not be the same for everyone so if anyone is inclined to share their personal experience with this, it’d be greatly appreciated!

164,Humira,Advice for going off Humira,"I was diagnosed about 5 years ago when I had a massive flare, had surgery, then got started on Humira (all within about two months). Humira has generally been good for me, but the side effects are getting to be a problem. For instance: I was diagnosed with Dyshidrotic Eczema this summer, I get frequent staph infections on my skin in response to any small abrasion (shaving my legs is a nightmare), cysts, frequent sinus infections and other sinus issues, plantar warts, and just a lot of other general side effects.

I have not had a flare in the five years I've been on Humira, and bloodwork, calprotectin, and colonoscopies are all showing deep remission.

I'm 22 and I don't want to be on Humira for life. And I don't want to switch to another biologic; I want to go completely off all medication. This sounds bold, but I have two family members (sister and uncle) with Crohn's who each had one giant flare, surgery, then no medication and they've been in remission for 25 and 45 years respectively. It seems like things are in my favor, but it's just hard to know what the right thing to do is.

I'm also still being seen by my pediatric GI doctor (in the process of transitioning to adult GI) and she doesn't want to me to go off Humira until I switch to adult GI (so they can follow my case for the next several years), but that won't be for another year at least, and the side effects are only getting worse with time.

So what I want to ask is this: Have any of you stopped taking Humira? If so, what was your experience like? Do you have any advice on how to stop (weaning off, cold turkey, etc.)? And any advice on controlling Crohn's through diet and lifestyle?

This is a long one, but thanks for sticking around!",2024-12-20 06:10:15,CrohnsDisease,6,1hidi54,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hidi54/advice_for_going_off_humira/,2024-12-20
165,Humira,Permanent joint pain argh,"I am at a bit of a loss right now and hoping some of my crohnies (see what I did there) can offer some of their experiences/insight/sign post me to helpful resources.

Been in remission for my Crohn's for the last 12 years since starting humira/anti tnf injections. However, I keep sprouting new auto immune diseases with every year that passes.

My most recent diagnosis was axial spondylarthritis - MRI was ok but they felt maybe humira was masking any signs of the arthritis as I had all of the symptoms and positive genetic marker. My back pain eventually settled and for the last couple of years have managed to live with it.

My current problem is permanent joint pain everywhere else - shoulder, knee, neck, sternum - ended up in a&amp;e this year for both knee pain and sternum pain which turned out to be costochrondritis.

Had a rheumatology appointment yesterday (NHS) and I came out feeling like I had no answers. No plan of how to resolve joint pain, no advice on how to manage and improve my qualify of life/live with this new normal.

I'm generally a happy go lucky person - tend to always see the positive in things. Gymmed regularly, lifted heavy, stretched meticulously, physio, you name it and I'd try it. Just don't seem to be bouncing back and around 9 months has passed living in this constant pain.

I just feel at a bit of a loss just now and it's really started affecting my mental health. 

I'm not writing this post for sympathy, I just wondered if anyone else who has been in this situation has successfully made progress or can signpost me to anywhere I could get helpful advice on how to adapt/manage.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. x

166,Humira,"Crohn’s, Skyrizi treatment, and fear","Hello everyone! It’s my first time writing here, this subreddit has already helped me a lot these months but now I feel like I need to ask personally.
I’m 22yo I’ve been diagnosed when I was 17 and up until now I had no problems and I did not require any treatment.
Around September 2024 I started this really bad flare (my first ever, really) that has been going on and getting progressively worse.
Time skipping to today, I got my first Skyrizi infusion.

I’d like to preface this by saying that I suffer from severe anxiety and I have panic attacks, I’ve been getting treatment for anxiety (SSRIs) for years now.
This brings me to the main thing: I am scared out of my mind.
Every single part of this unfortunate journey has been terrifying to me, and has severely impacted on my everyday life.
Now that I’ve started treatment i know that I should feel relieved but I can’t help to still be terrified.
I would like to ask to you people your experiences with skyrizi and crohns in general.

I’ve read that usually Skyrizi is used when other treatments don’t work, but I was put on it as my first biologic.. has anyone here started right out with skyrizi too? Should i be concerned?
(It should be noted that I had unresponsive results to Quantiferon different times so I suppose that’s a reason why I didn’t start with humira or similar ones..)

I don’t know I feel like I’ve been losing my mind and I’m stuck in this tunnel of doubts and fears and what ifs, and it’s getting exhausting.
I guess I’m looking for some reassurance? Or if anyone has tips on how to better control the situation mentally.. 
I am considering going back to therapy because I realise my thought process is overwhelming me with anxiety…

Thanks to you if you’ve read until here.

170,Humira,What is CD like long term?,"Hi everyone! Condensed version of the back story:

- Diagnosed in July 2024
- Started Humira end of August 2024

Generally, I’ve been feeling pretty good the last few months. My joint/body pain almost completely went away after starting Humira, and abdominal pain gradually tapered off.

Within the last two weeks, I noticed more frequent abdominal pain on and off throughout the day, but nothing horrible (chalked it up to eating Thanksgiving leftovers for most of the week last week). 

Last night was the first time since starting Humira that I had pain so bad I couldn’t stand up straight. It has since subsided and I generally feel ok today. 

My main question: is it normal/ possible to get these random “flares” (?) while still “managing” the disease. I know most are gonna say it’s different for everyone which i totally understand. But just want to know everyone’s experiences who’s like to offer it.

171,Humira,Will it get worse?,"I've had symptoms for about 3–4 years, including diarrhea, blood in my stool, chronic low hemoglobin and iron levels, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. However, I only started treatment around two months ago. Currently, I take one Humira 40mg injection every two weeks.

My symptoms feel mild to low. I occasionally experience diarrhea, and blood in my stool only appears a couple of times a year, lasting for a few days before stopping. It has been a while since I last had blood in my stool. I also rarely have stomach pain.

What worries me is that whenever I research Crohn's disease, I see people suffering from much more severe symptoms than mine. This scares me, especially because I sometimes forget that I even have Crohn's. Does having mild symptoms mean I’m in the early stages, and things might or will get worse in the future? Or are there people who have lived with Crohn's for many years but still experience mild symptoms and lead happy lives?

I hope everyone dealing with this gets better. I would really appreciate any information or insights. Thank you in advance.

172,Humira,Two Biologics,"Hi all! 
I'm relatively new to my IBD journey, and I'm currently working on getting into remission.

Previous to my Crohns diagnoses I already had another autoimmune condition which I take biologics for (a biosimiliar of humira that I can't spell lol), it works great for my autoimmune condition but unfortunately doesn't seem to be helping my crohns very much at all.

I saw my specialist yesterday and she has asked that I begin taking Stelera in the New Year.

Now, I have no issue with taking biologics, the needles are okay, side effects are worth it and I'm so blessed to live in a country with free health care.

My question is, has anyone else been on two biologics at one? What was the experience like for you? How did your body cope?

I'm grateful and excited at the idea of having medication to make me feel better but I'm starting to feel nervous about what all these medications will do to my body once I'm old.

173,Humira,Could crohns early in life affect mental health/development? (Rant/Questions?),"Hi so I will try and keep this from rambling(though it is long) but I've been told recently I'm far too hard on myself and had questions, for context I was diagnosed at an early age around seven as my memory serves, the crohns progressed quickly and in the span of a few years I went from a little sick to blacking out in between classes and constant stomach pain eventually ulcers internal bleeding all those lovely side effects. From that point my life honestly seems so small,I don't really remember what things were like before you know? eventually no school would take me on so I self educated the best I could though every two or three years I would need to change medicine or get a surgery done because I got really sick or inflamed (humira cimzia remicade and now skyrizi) and that cycles been going on till recently, I'm 27 now I've had one part time job in the past few years, after recovering from ileostomy surgery and feeling healthier, but blacked out on my first weekend shift....while holding food for two tables so I was very politely let go. My family has told me they love me and I will always have a home with them, but I cant shake this deep shame and guilt. I'm nearly thirty, living with my parents, cant hold down a job and I don't even know how to pick my life back up from here, they invested so much into keeping me alive and I fear I have nothing to show for it. For the past few years I have felt more undeserving with every scrap of food I take off the table and night spent in my bed but no matter what new angle or trick or sheer determination I try I feel like my wheels either just spin in place or I wake up back in a hospital bed because I pushed past my breaking point. I guess all that leads up to questions I can only ask you all. Have any of you felt similarly stuck in life at some point? Did your life change much after your diagnosis? If you also were diagnosed super early in life what was it like for you and how did you learn to move past it?  Thank you everyone who read this far and im sorry if this rant in any ways upsets/offends anyone or if I am inadvertently speaking way out of line/out of turn I've become somewhat reclusive and have little/rusty experience talking to others besides my doctors,family and friend group I hope you all have a wonderful evening and thank you again for a moment of your time.

181,Humira,Advice for Biologics,"TLDR: Crohn's or something else, do I start on biologics? Help needed 😭

Hi All, 

I have recently been diagnosed with Crohn's earlier this year. I had somewhat relief on steroids, and now my GI is recommending biologics. She has offered Stelara vs Hurmia. I read up on both and opted for Stelara but unfortunately refused because my crohns is classified as mild.

A bit about my symptoms summarized; I've had chronic diarrhea for 10+ years, first test was left colonoscopy 2016 (sigmoidoscopy) which was normal, and diagnosed with IBS. A few months after this scope I developed very bad acid reflux to which I end up vomiting blood. Had OGD and it showed inflammation. Fast forward to late 2023/2024 I had serve bloating (so much so,  that people were congratulating me on my non existent pregnancy), I nievely though the 'IBS' was just worsening and the diarrhea and constant reflux was normal for me, until I had several episodes of bloody and or mucous stool. Went back to GP who referred me back to GI and got full colonoscopy this time not just left colon. It showed inflammation in right colon and terminal ileus which was followed by a small bowel MRE that confirmed inflammation but uncharacteristic to definitely diagnosis chrohns and tissue sampling was recommended.

Tissue sampling then was non diagnostic with further molecules to rule out lymphoma/leukemia which also suggested radiological findings... Anywho, my GI is convinced it is Crohn's now because the steroids helped with symptoms and now wants to start steroids. 

Long story short (even though I know I've rambled on) but I feel like I am an imposter in this group reading the worse you have all been through and I am so new to this. I am nervous to start biologics because of the unsure past, but also craving relief from what id class as mild symptoms compared to what people with severe crohns go through.

Has anyone had a positive experience with Humira and how did you find it? Am I crazy thinking the Stelara refused was a sign to not start biologics😭
My mind is all over the place, yes I want relief from symptoms but I am afraid to try something that will immunosupress me and may not be the answer...

182,Humira,My experiences with Crohns,"This isn't a story of how it destroyed my life and how things never get better. 

I'm writing this to give someone hope that things can be better and or will get better with some effort.


Around 2013, I was diagnosed with Crohns. I went from 145 pounds down to 90s pounds in close to 5 months. My parents, friends and family thought I'd likely die and to be frank it was close. When it was fully diagnosed I had 26 inches of damaged intestine and a 5 inch split on the inner lining. I spent close to 2 weeks in the hospital during this period.


I eventually got medical help ended up on Humira for a number of years with yearly flair ups that would put me in the hospital. When I finally started getting better my weight jumped massively (about 1.5 years after being put on Humira). There were weeks when I was putting on 10 pounds plus. I ended up weighting 180 pounds and started to get fat. A new experience for me. This is where things began to change.


About 2 years (2015),  after initially being sick, I ended up 180 pounds. So I decided to give the Gym a try and it was the first step in truly getting better. I packed on some muscle and got into pretty good shape over the next several years. During this period, I didn't end up having any flair ups or hospital stays. I had to remain on Humira though I did try remove myself a few times with no luck. 

Then came 2020, not going to lie, I thought I was in deep shit here. I no longer had a gym to go to and Humira made it so I was even more at risk of catching Covid. Luckily, a friend of mine got me into Yoga,meditation, breathwork and cold plunges. Within a few months I attempted to take myself off of Humira and it worked. My specialist was pissed and said I was crazy. It's now been almost 5 years since I stopped taking Humira. I last saw my Specialist in the summer of 23 and she was shocked. After some evasive tests and blood work there was no signs of me having crohns. She flat out told me I was one of the lucky ones and to keep up the good work. Then said she'd see me in a decade unless something bad happened. It's been a year since and I'm still kicking ass and feeling amazing.

Before Entyvio, I was on Humira auto-injector pens (before the switch to citrate-free formula), and was starting to develop a complex about injecting myself due to the click and the sting. 
Could anyone who has done both comment on how Entyvio injections are in comparison? I would be open to either pen or syringe if it turns out that I need to increase frequency. 
Has anyone who switched from infusion to injection regretted it?
Any insights welcome :)",2024-11-09 02:01:14,CrohnsDisease,2,1gmzf20,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1gmzf20/entyvio_injection_experience_vs_humira/,2024-11-09
186,Humira,just want a stable life,"bit of a rant, just looking for advice.

F21, first diagnosed with crohns at 18. I’ve been through mercaptopurine, infliximab, stelara and now about to change to humira… I also have a recent ankylosing spondylitis diagnosis. I’ve just finished uni though I’m going back to study as I started my degree pre crohns and I’ve come to realise that working full time in this field is just not an option for me. I can barely even work part time due to fatigue and wasn’t even able to complete my last colonoscopy bc I was too sick. 

Am just craving an alternate reality where I can relate to my friends and party, and work normal hours. I want to have the average coming of age experience and flat with friends without being scared of using a shared toilet 💗

187,Humira,Medication Experiences,"Just had my review and my pesky crohns is being a pain in the ass. Got it early and it’s semi behaving itself but showing signs of flaring as I taper off my pred. I’m currently on humira. But my consultant wants to move me off it. My options are;

Infliximab/Remicade
Ustekinumab/sterlara
Upadacitinib/Rinvoq
Rizankizumab/skyrizi

He’s given his opinion and also I have my own opinion. 

Just wanted to know others experiences both from side effects, how quickly it worked etc, but also logistics as some require infusions 

For additional context, I am awaiting Barbie butt surgery but cannot have it due to my perianal crohns not settling hence the medication change. Work wise I have a varying work schedule so it’s difficult to predict where I’ll be and what I’ll be doing. My employer is great to accommodate things. My mindset is default “I hate having to manage things” and want the path of least resistance and most flexibility.

As I say, I have my opinion on what’s been said and what I know so far, but appreciate anyone’s opinions who have tried them.

188,Humira,"Remicade quit working and now on Humira, but not going great","I am a 38yo male that began my Crohns journey about 10 years ago when I was diagnosed with UC/IBD.  I had a colonoscopy and bloodwork done and my GI said there was something going on but didn’t really know what to pin it on.  Either way, i was put on 1.6 g of Lialda.  In the next 7 years I had 2 flairs that took better part of 4 months to correct with steroids.  Fast forward to 2021, a new flair, and now a new GI, he ordered another colonoscopy and now we have moved into Crohns.  Shortly there after I started Remicade infusions every 8 weeks.  I’ll tell you what, that was a miracle drug.  Almost the day after my flare took an about face and we moved right into remission.  Times were good until May/June of this year when i changed jobs and insurance and my new insurance didn’t want me to stay the course of Remicade and put me on Inflectra.  There was a lot going on at this time, i was about 2 weeks late for my infusion.  When i did get Inflectra i went into sever reaction where i need to great steroids and Benadryl to get me out of it.  Bloodwork confirmed that i have build antibodies against this biologic and now were are onto different meds, Humira.  While all this is going on, I’m into another flare and really frustrated what to do.  It’s a really weird flare.  I think the Humira is helping my lower GI and BMs, but i am having abdominal pain and arthritis through my entire body.  I can’t sleep, i am popping Tylenol like tic tacs.  I have called this out to my GI and he ordered Budesonide and Hyoscyamine, which helps but isn’t getting me 100% there.  I am new to this community on Reddit and was hoping someone here has had any similar experiences or suggestions.",2024-11-05 13:22:42,CrohnsDisease,6,1gk6jha,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1gk6jha/remicade_quit_working_and_now_on_humira_but_not/,2024-11-05

Some of the required tests take about 2 weeks and my dose is supposed to be tomorrow. It can be 1 or 2 doses that i may miss. 

My own doc in my hometown is really bothered by this, as am i. Has anyone had to miss a dose this long? Im considering going to my hometown to get it, even tho its far and my midterm week.

192,Humira,Kidney failure from entyvio?,"Curious to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences. I was on humira for about a year before i started getting fevers. The longer i went, the shorter the interval got for me having fevers until it was almost every day. No gi symptoms at all.

Rheum, infectious disease, and gastro all decided it was serum sickness. I stopped the med and was in prednisone for a couple months while insurance approved entyvio.

Started entyvio induction. A few weeks in i started getting crazy fatigue, fevers, and my appetite disappeared. Probably 2 months after starting entyvio i got a CMP and was in acute renal failure. Ended up getting a biopsy positive for acute interstitial nephritis which is almost always caused by an allergic rxn to a medication. The only new med that i had started was entyvio so we stopped it and i started a super long high dose course of prednisone to treat it. 

Now i am stuck with a little bit of residual kidney disease, but its never gotten worse again so we still assume it was the entyvio. None of my giant team of drs had ever seen it and there are only a handful of published case studies on it.

193,Humira,Tattoos &amp; Piercings,"Hello all!

I have been on Humira for about 4-5 months now and I take it biweekly. I have already begun to feel the effects of it altering my immune system such as upper respiratory sensitivity, especially in the morning. It honestly isn't very new to me, just feels like heightened allergies really.

I already have 20+ tattoos and 8 piercings, but this was all before beginning the biologic for my Crohn's. When getting tattoos, I have always had a bit of a slower healing time (bigger tattoos mainly) and piercings always have different healing processes. Sometimes I would get the sniffles when healing, tattoo flu I guess?

I was wondering if anyone has any tips or experiences getting tattoos/piercings while on the biologic.

However... I've had a bit of a rough time with my disease recently, and I got a colonoscopy a few days after switching to Enytvio after a decade of Humira.

Fairly normal procedure, ""active disease"" reported. Knew it, time to knuckle down... or so I thought. A few hours later, I'm bed-ridden with a near 102 fever and flu-like symptoms. Off to the hospital for a day and a half out of caution... where I've learned nobody knows crohn's symptoms and everyone wants your money. Some rounds of anti-biotics and rest later, I'm fine.

ANYWAY - the real question. Does anyone get these random infections or spikes in sickness? I've been keenly aware of my immune system status but haven't had anything happen like this before... any experience? Any ways to help defend? Feeling quite confused.

196,Humira,Need Advice on Choosing a Biologic ,"Hey everyone,

A few days ago, I posted that I’m currently not on any medication for Crohn’s and was looking for suggestions. As mentioned, my recent results showed scarring and ulcers in the terminal ileum from my last colonoscopy, and my symptoms have been relatively stable with occasional abdominal pain and fatigue. My recent MRE confirmed mild to moderate inflammation in the distal ileum, and my CRP was 2.6 mg/L with fecal calprotectin at 263 µg/g. I’ve managed without medication for a while, but with these findings, my GI and I agreed it’s time to start treatment.

Today, I had a follow-up with my GI, and he’s left it up to me to decide which biologic to start. Here’s the list of options he provided:

	•	Infliximab (Remicade) – IV
	•	Adalimumab (Humira) – Subcutaneous (SQ) every 2 weeks
	•	Vedolizumab (Entyvio) – IV or SQ every 2 weeks
	•	Ustekinumab (Stelara) – SQ
	•	Risankizumab (Skyrizi) – SQ every 8 weeks
	•	Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) – Oral

He doesn’t have a strong preference, as all have about a 35-40% success rate. Based on what I’ve read about the risk profiles, dosing frequency, and SQ injections at home, I’m leaning towards Risankizumab (Skyrizi), as it’s only every 8 weeks and seems to have fewer systemic side effects.

I’m looking for any suggestions or recommendations from others who have experience with these treatments. Thank you!",2024-10-21 18:40:49,CrohnsDisease,8,1g8x87n,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1g8x87n/need_advice_on_choosing_a_biologic/,2024-10-21

After countless tests, etc they decided to put me on Skyrizi, I’ve had the initial 3 infusions in hospital and had no side effects or issues with that, then this week I started with the medication at home (the nurse came out and showed me how to do it, etc) and I felt fine at first like normal, but the next day and since then I’ve felt progressively worse… I’ve started to have abdominal pains, random spouts of nausea, back pains, fatigue, hot flushes, and it’s all been happening since I took the last dose. Before that last dose I actually felt okay, I felt fine, had a couple of gripes here and there but I was feeling better than I had done. It’s very weird and I have bad anxiety about my health anyway, but are these side effects normal? My Dr had said I may get headaches or tiredness, but that was all they said…

207,Stelara,advice please,"i’m don’t ever post in groups so please forgive me if it’s a little all over the place. 

I’m a 23F in Qld aus. I was diagnosed at 16 in 2019 after a family history and alarming symptoms. 
My fecal calprotection was 1356 at diagnosis in may 2019 and the worst flare i have ever experienced (until recently) in sep 2019 was 1460 

6 weeks ago i had a 6am start and got up at 5 and started vomiting with cramping diarrhoea that was black as well (they said it was melena). 
it went away for a week then came back for my 2 6am starts the following week. Since then I have been terrible ill with the worst flare i have ever been in. I have been in contact with my GI team the whole time but all they have done is ordered bloods and virus tests. I have an MRI on wednesday (now monday) 

i had a gastroscopy two to three weeks ago and that came back clear with mild gastritis. 

i have had temporary constipation throughout and that was diagnosed as fecal loading which i tried to clear with tablet laxatives (made everything so much worse) and finally took the lactolose which i believe has cleared since i have been going to the bathroom with urgency 4 times a day. 
my fecal calprotection is 1630 and i’ve tried budesonide but that made me almost pass out and had the usual steroid fast heart rate and symptoms and have been advised to stop usage. 
I got prednisone almost a week ago but the GI i saw at the urgent clinic (didn’t have any empathy at all) said to not take it unless it’s unbareable (which it is now but i am so scared to take as it causes constipation and they have been saying the whole time “we aren’t sure if this is a crohns flare as we can’t see any parts of your bowel inflamed on he ultrasound” which they have never been able to see inflamation in) and i am so scared to get bound up again as the liquid laxatives make me feel 10x worse. 

My pain through the past 6 weeks have been 5-10/10 and currently is 6/10. (The 10/10 was once when i took the duocolax) 
i am on stelara but they have been talking about a switch. They suggested admitted me for when i have a colonoscopy because i get so so sick when i take the prep but i am also so scared to do the colonoscopy because of the effects of the prep and in previous scopes they have given me someone else’s information, treated me appalling and have been really unsympathetic to any pain and nausea i’ve had pre and post scope.

So i’m basically just begging to see if anyone has gone through anything similar and can tell me what it is/ what they did for it and what i need to look out for that would suggest immediate ER. 

Thank you in advance, coming from one cronhns paitent who has no one who can give advice who knows about crohns in her life. 

Also would be grateful if any aussies could share their experience in ERs with crohns

edit: i would also like to note that the bad experiences are with the other GIs i’ve had to have during this flare as I can only see my own GI (who has been seeing me since i was 17) when I have an appointment which can take weeks to months to get. I would desperately hate to change GIs after the doc i have been seeing for my disease has been my doc since basically 6 months after diagnosis. 
also the nausea has gone down a lot since the intial vomiting episodes.

208,Stelara,Just Had My First-Ever Remission After Years with Crohn’s – A Message of Hope,"Hey everyone,


I just wanted to share something that I hope might give some encouragement to anyone out there who’s currently struggling with Crohn’s. Yesterday, for the first time in my life, I found out I’m officially in remission.


To give a bit of background: I was diagnosed with severe Crohn’s when I was 14. Last year was particularly rough. I had to undergo a resection of my terminal ileum because I kept ending up in the ER with blockages. I even had to wear a colostomy bag for eight months and was on prednisone for a long stretch, which really took its toll on me.



Now, at 25, I’m finally seeing a remission for the first time. I still have to give myself Stelara injections every four weeks, and my insurance premiums are through the roof, but honestly, I’m just so grateful to be here and to have reached this milestone.



This community has been such a huge help to me. Just reading everyone’s experiences, learning what to ask my doctors, and seeing that others have gone through similar or even tougher journeys has been so comforting. I just want to say thank you to all of you for being here and for supporting each other. Love you guys and want you to live the best and healthiest life.

214,Stelara,Your coping strategies? Pretty new to all this,"You have heard this story before so I'll keep it short. I'm 28 and my Crohn's first started last February. Things went downhill pretty fast, I was hospitalized in April and spent a few weeks there on IV steroids and other things. I'm in remission now on a monthly dose of Stelara and it gave me my life back. I adhere to a strict diet and don't go out as much, but most days feel normal again. I got back into work, uni and everybody is being awfully nice about it. Still, I'm looking for a way to cope with abdominal pain, joint pains and this feeling of inner tension, which I think started with the roids and never fully went away. What I want to avoid is putting more chemical drugs into my body.

Humor is a big thing for me. I started watching standup again, listening to podcasts I like and directing my attention towards funny things in general. I also play a lot of video games and I'm trying to be more aware of how I feel while playing, as in entertained vs. stressed out.

I keep a safe distance from weed (had panic attacks a decade ago) but started looking into CBD for symptom relief as I read people's positive experiences on here. The hype is kind of over but CBD is still being marketed as a natural remedy for all sorts of things, which is why I prefer reading personal stories.

Tell me what your thing is and how you cultivate a positive attitude.

215,Stelara,I am starting the process of participating in a T-reg cell therapy trial for CD,"Update 10/28/2025:

Some bad news.

Well, its the day of the screening colonoscopy, I had just finished prep, getting ready to head over to my doctors office, and I get a call from my coordinator that the company decided to cancel my participation since I ""wasnt severe enough"" according to my submitted daily questionnaire. Didn't tell me the day before I started prep, didn't let me at least get the procedure so I can have for my records. Nope, Tr1x Bio decided to wait till right now. Even my coordinator sounded devastated, like he was telling me a family member died. All blame goes to the sponsor with the company, but coordinator and doctor had no say in the decisions...

Just got to my doctors office and it sounds like my insurance is all good with me still getting scoped, since originally Tr1x Bio was supposed to pay for it. Fingers crossed!

So it seems like I got kicked out due to not having abdominal pain, not cause of how my blood work, scope, or other reports symptom reports. I wish I had seen this criteria, but regardless it does say And/Or, so i technically could have qualified, but they said ""Nah"".

‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: I am undergoing a screening for TRX103, and am happy to share my experience as I progress. There is a chance I may not pass the screening process and won't recieve the treatment. 



After 5 years of trying 4 different treatments, with Stelara being my first treatment and Rinvoq being my last, I have been recommended by my GI specialist to try an experimental T-reg therapy (TRX103). 

I've seen a few posts on the subreddit from the past regarding similar types treatment, so its not super new, but it is not a common treatment for crohns and I am not aware of any commercial uses of this therepy outside of cancer patients. 

My understanding is that the goal of the treatment is an immune system reset, meaning that the t-reg cells will essentially teach the body not to attack itself, specifically in the immune pathways that causes Crohns. The goal seems to be to create a long lasting treatment that can last years with a single infusion. Not once have I heard the words cure be used by any of thr coordinators, no one knows how long the treatment will last, but the goal is indefinitely. 

Currently I am in the screening phase. There is a chance that I will not be accepted if I dont show inflammation in my small bowel during my upcoming scoping. Last scoping over a year ago showed no inflammation in my small bowel. I also almost failed screening due to low WBC count, but my 2nd blood test showed improvement. 

Rinvoq worked to some extent for me, but seemed to not fully relieve the inflammation after being on it for 15 months. I also had a few flareups while on Rinvoq during that time frame. As part of the screening, I am currently not on any treatments until after the colonscopy, which I will be allowed to have prednisone. After almost a week being off meds, symptoms are definitely returning, slowly, but surely. A new symptom is itchiness on my face and torso. 

I will post updates as I progress. I am happy to answer questions about the process. I won't share anything about where I am doing the study, but you can find public info regarding TRX103 if you search it up.

219,Stelara,Switching Meds,"Hi, I was diagnosed with CD a little over a year ago after nearly 6 years of dealing with symptoms, seeing multiple doctors, etc. (most here will be familiar with this ordeal) So, long story short: I had a bowel obstruction which landed me in the hospital, which lead to being finally diagnosed. Anyways, I was prescribed Prednisone and Azathioprine. My GI weaned me off Prednisone and I’ve been on Azathioprine since. 

For most part I’ve been well, the first few months post hospitalization was crazy as I was spinning from the diagnosis, and dealing with many side effects (SE) of Prednisone &amp; weaning off of it. I also dealt with Anemia &amp; joints pain. I’ve done what I could to control my inflammation/CRP levels, however nearly a year had passed and it’s still high so my GI did a scope, she could not pass through my ileocecal valve; a MRI was done my ileocecal valve was very narrow due to inflammation. So it’s been established (besides high CRP, my other symptoms include bloating, loss of appetite, loose BM &amp; borborygmus) that Azathioprine isn’t working as it should so my GI is switching me to Stelara.

So the reason that brought me here: Stelara. 
I would like to hear people’s experience with the medication - the good, the bad &amp; the ugly - so I can prepare myself. I’m anxious with the switch for many reasons such as SE, needles/giving myself the shots. 

Also, unrelated: anyone else here experience weight gain/difficulty losing weight? 

Thank you in advance for any comments &amp; advice. 💜

220,Stelara,"New ileocecal resection, what pain level is normal with 72 hours post-laparoscopic surgery?","My husband and I are American, but we live in Portugal. He has had Crohn’s for nearly 25 years, some years better, some worse, currently on Stelara, with excellent public care here in Portugal. (Biologics are only available in the public system here). His initial diagnosis at 18 years old was at his terminal ileum, where, despite current control of his disease, he has built enough scar tissue in that area to necessitate a preventative ileocecal resection (stricture was impending) that just happened this Tuesday. Today, Friday, he is still in excruciating pain. He is in Hospital Santa Maria (Lisbon) and the pain management is lacking, with only paracetamol (Tylenol) every six hours after one initial dose of morphine on Tuesday night. Now, the pain has become so severe they’ve gone back to morphine during the night, with a paracetamol drip during the day. It’s been nearly 72 hours since his surgery. Should I be demanding further evaluation for anastomotic leakage, infection, abscess? Or is this level of pain still in the realm of normal at this stage. I’m having a difficult time getting anyone to answer my questions and he is in no shape to be demanding. Language is not a barrier, but restricted hours and no telephone responsiveness are. I’m kind of just venting, but also looking for reassure this may be normal post-surgery experience. Help? 

UPDATE: Turns out his excessive and unexpected pain is being caused by ileus, in other words, no intestinal motility, which could be exacerbated by opioids, hence the hesitation in increasing them. He’s now feeling better with a nasogastric drain for fluid buildup in his stomach; new pain meds (still some morphine); preventative iv antibiotics; iv anti-inflammatory; and medication meant to facilitate motility. The surgical anastomosis still looks in good shape, no leak or infection, just some inflammation.

223,Stelara,Career Change with Crohn's - Any Skilled Trades People Here?,"Hi!
Some background: I (31F) got diagnosed with Crohn's a few years ago and have been on Stelara ever since. I've thankfully been pretty much normal except for a couple random mini flares (one week long) this year when I tried gluten free buns + stress. I'm back to grain free and my more limited diet, and it is helping me feel better again. TMI... I tend to lean constipation instead of diarrhea, unless there's a random flare. I am at around 1-3 bowels a day average with some stomach pain.

I am in the midst of a career change from being self-employed running a photography business. I am tired of the stress, inconsistent paycheck, customer service, and being at a desk a lot of the time. Stress and certain foods are my biggest triggers. I feel much better when I've been on a photoshoot moving around, problem solving, and being creative. I'm sore and tired after if it's a full-day shoot, but I have never had any issues with my Crohn's so far on set or after *knock on wood*

Currently, I've become interested in the skilled trades, particularly electrical. I looked at plumbing as well, but I've heard it's even harder on the body.

I feel like my body is fading away when I'm at my desk and inside this much. I feel better when I'm stronger physically from being active, but I'm not great about going to a gym (going to try again, I just keep forgetting). I tend to get muscle fast but also lose it fast.

I'm wondering if anyone here with Crohn's or UC is an electrician or plumber? Or another skilled trade?

Is it doable? Are your bosses understanding? Did you have to leave your trade, or are you still with it? Do you get flexible leave for appointments and feeling sick? Is it better to go union or non-union with Crohn's? I cannot lose health insurance obviously. 

The trades just seems to be calling to me. I know it's even tougher than what I do now, but I also feel like I'm hurting my body by not being active as much. The constant stress of no money, inconsistency, and having to wear all the hats is what makes me sick. The thought of going to work at a desk and dealing with office politics is awful at this point tbh too.

I know this is very niche for this community, but hoping someone can give me a realistic take on it with your experiences! Thanks!",2025-10-14 05:14:09,CrohnsDisease,1,1o66tn0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1o66tn0/career_change_with_crohns_any_skilled_trades/,2025-10-14

Started on Yesintek, a Stelara biosimilar.

I’ve been on Prednisone for about 4 weeks and have 4 more weeks to go(40mg taper over 8 weeks). Things have been pretty good ever since I started Prednisone. Not 100% but damn close to it. 

Had my first infusion yesterday. A didn’t feel much. Nurse was checking on me every 10-15 mins and asked about any symptoms I’m feeling. He was adamant about letting him know ASAP if I feel any itching. 
My arm would feel a little warm randomly at times but nothing uncomfortable and the nurse didnt see it as a red flag. 

Overall a 10/10 experience.

Now is the waiting game and starting injections in 8 weeks. 

Just wanted to share this to give Hope and courage to anyone else that’s recently diagnosed and is afraid or nervous about starting a biologic or doing an infusion.

I don’t know if yesintek will work cause it’s wayyy to early to tell. I don’t know how I will react to the shots. All I know is that taking it day by day has been far better for my mental health than worrying about what might happen in the future.

There is a hydrocele there and it’s so painful I can’t walk or run or cycle.

The consultants response was “at least the side effect wasn’t malignancy , we can’t do anything about this , maybe you could wear high raised pants to support this”.

I’m absolutely furious at this and their oversll response. The fluid could at least be aspired and even if that doesn’t work thrte are surgeries. I’m only 48 and dnt intend to have my bladder and urinary systems left like this because of side effects of a drug

233,Stelara,Stelara Effectiveness/your experiences,"Hello Crohnies,

  
I 19m have been playing the Australian medical system waiting game all year to get approved for Stelara for my small bowel crohns disease. I started getting symptoms back in february this year and I was diagnosed around August (very lucky it didnt take me long to get diagnosed in comparison to some of the horror stories I've heard)

  
I've had an expansive experience, it's been a long time of just waking up in pain and spending a lot of time at home suffering with the persistent tenesmus and diarrhoea, you guys know what it's like 😂. 

  
However as of the last 2 months my experience has ramped up a lot, I spent a week in hospital being flushed with IV corticosteroids and got my prednisone dose upped a lot, to a degree where I began to see steroid induced psychiatric effects of hallucinations and delusions and suicidal ideation (not that I'd ever do it, they're entirely intrusive thoughts). Also ended up having some weird OD/psychiatric fit that placed me in hospital after taking opioids for the pain (prescribed by hospital, and taken correct amount, I think I have a drug sensitivity problem too)

  
I guess my quesiton is that the doctor, and few other people that I know that are on biologics keep trying to sell me on this idea that you begin biologics and then your life can get back to basically normal. I want to know:

(I will be going on stelara, however I've heard it doesn't really matter which one you're on)

\- How close to normal (pre-symptom/diagnosis) do biologics bring you?

\- When on biologics will a flare up still likely hospitalised me (got hospitalised when only on azathioprine and budesonide, so I assume a flare wont be as bad on better drugs right?)

\- Can you bulk/enjoy the gym for the purpose of building muscle as effectively as I enjoyed to pre crohns.

\- The statistics for crohns surgery rates are HIGH, to my understanding this incorporates pre-biologic surgery rates... however is it still likely that any individual with crohns (mine sitting in the mild-moderate range on the Crohns Disease Activity Index) gets surgery, essentially am I looking at a future of strictureplasty/bowel resectioning.

\- Are there better foods that I can eat in the mean time to manage symptoms and maybe get less pain (currently **ONLY** eating: white bread with small amount of butter, salmon and rice with no seasoning or sauce, and white pasta with 5%&lt; lean beef mince with a small amount of tomato paste)

\- Any other tips/tricks/helpful info that will help me dealing with pain/tenesmus/diarrhoea (havent done a solid poo since february 5th) that will help me get through the next 4 months of waiting for Stelara to kick in?

\- Any thing niche that I should ask my specialist that is a good idea to know (any specifics or general quesitons that a specialist can answer that would be more tailored to my situation directly that you guys can't answer but know would be good information for me to know from him, if you know what im trying to say by this question)

237,Stelara,Meds For The First Time,"Hey Everyone, 

Was looking for some feedback from anyone. Here’s a little background for what I’ve been dealing with Crohn’s Disease. Any shared experiences or feedback would be so helpful!

My Crohn’s History (Quick Summary):

Diagnosis: Crohn’s disease (2020) after a blockage. Had bad stomach pains for a month, doctor didn’t really know what it was. Had to be in the hospital then eventually get surgery. This was the first time I learned I had Crohn’s and I was 30 years old. 

Surgery: Had ~8 inches of ileum removed due to obstruction/stricture.

Current Disease Location: Primarily in the ileum.

Labs/Monitoring:
Ongoing mild inflammation on scopes and bloodwork.

Fecal calprotectin recently elevated → indicates active flare despite diet/supplements.
Have needed iron supplementation for anemia and I take a bunch of anti inflammatory vitamins.

Treatment so far: Managed with diet, supplements, lifestyle (avoiding meds until now).

Now at a crossroads: Considering starting Stelara.
	•	Hoping for control of inflammation without the long-term risks of unchecked Crohn’s (strictures, surgeries, cancer risk).
	•	Weighing Stelara’s safety profile and side effects vs. the risks of staying untreated.

6 months ago they finally reffered her to a gastroenterologist, they did a colonoscopy and found ulcers covering 70% of her lower right colon they gave her a crohns score of 7 they took biopsies and her calprotectin levels were extremely high.

They put her on pantaprazol which she had an allergic reaction to then they put her on rabprazol and she had a reaction to that aswell, so they stopped prescribing her anything because they didn't know what to give her.

Originally she refused then mri and they did and ultrasound instead then she got a call from a random nurse not the gastro, talking to her about stelara and they casually dropped the bomb on her that she has crohns 2 months after she had reactions to the other medications.

She went back and asked for the mri and if he could check everything else because there's a history of other bowel diseases in her family but not crohns.

The specialists response has left her disheartened and distrusting due to his arrogance, his exact words were ""even if the mri shows something else he believes it would be that plus crohns, even if the mri shows no signs of crohns he still believes its crohns"" so his mind is made up that she has crohns no matter what!!

Now I am going to be paying for her to see a private gastroenterologist, because the public health system in Australia can be pretty rubbish (it's free and you get what you pay for tbh) 

I am wondering if there's anything else we should make sure is checked, no matter how obscure or out there it is? 

She's extremely scared of taking stelara because she's prone to having adverse reactions to medications, so I want to hear if people have had either good or bad experiences with stelara? 

The last question is kinda selfish, I want to know if it gets better don't get me wrong no matter what I will stand by her side but it is tough on both of us, I will only cook and eat what she can eat which is pretty bland tbh (I used to be a chef and I love food, I miss pasta), it sucks seeing her in pain all the time i wish i could just take away all her pain, we had to stop a lot of our hobbies leaving us both house bound a large amount of the time, (we used to fire twirl, hike and workout. We have a magnesium pool in our new house which is nice, we are both gamers so we are happy to game together but I do miss being active). We are still sexually active but I feel bad because afterwards she complains her stomachs in agony, so I completely avoid initiating because I feel guilty for hurting her. We were trying for a baby but after the diagnosis that has taken a back-seat because we don't want to make her stomach worse. 

Basically there's not one aspect of our life that is not impacted but no matter what I won't leave her nor do I speak about how it's affecting me because that would be immoral and a dick move, so I put my happy face on and support her like any other man would but I'm hoping things get better for her sake and my own.",2025-08-24 08:08:19,CrohnsDisease,2,1mypuzp,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mypuzp/questions_and_advice/,2025-08-24
242,Stelara,Managing Crohn’s in College,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with UC when I was 13 but last week was hospitalized by a fistula and rediagnosed to Crohn’s at age 21. 

I stuck with a very strict diet during my first years of school and luckily didn’t really have any issues with significant bleeding after nights with alcohol, though i’m worried with this new diagnosis how restrictive I will need to be. I’m not a huge drinker by any means but it is really helpful for my social anxiety (calms me down, makes me more extroverted) and I feel like it helps me fit in with the crowd too. 

I’m also looking for some advice about how to manage fatigue symptoms while balancing classes, socialization, and sleep. I have ADHD so caffeine has an opposite effect on me, I usually take Adderal but crash as soon as I get home after classes. 

I let my professors know about my diagnosis and I have accommodations through the school that allow unlimited bathroom breaks, and my professors are usually understanding enough to be lenient on assignments and such. University policy is pretty strict with the total number of days you can miss though.

I’m moving from Stelara + mesalamine to Remicade + methotrexate. From what I understand, it is moderately more of an immunosuppressant than what I had before. I usually get really sick (bedridden from a cold) around 3 times a year, and tend to miss 4 days of classes to recover, and I’m worried that with the more extreme immunosuppressant I’m going to miss even more. 

Side note- how do you guys handle sick days at work??? Do you just WFH, have really nice bosses, or have special accommodations for it? I’m so worried since it’s my last year of uni and I’m entering the US workforce so soon. 

I’d appreciate some advice from someone who’s gone through similar experiences. This new diagnosis is a bit overwhelming especially with classes starting so soon.

I really don't know who to ask. I figure other crohnies might know from experience. But I had a little problem with my stelara today. I've been taking stelara for over a year now. Been an absolute wonder and I'm so happy to have it. Today I did everything I was supposed to. I clean the area with an alcohol swab, I waited a second for it to try. I have the area a bit of a pinch, I put the tip up to my skin and gave the tinniest little push...then I sneezed. I didn't think I moved so I stabbed myself and injected myself. I quickly push the plunger down because I felt another sneeze building and I was trying to hurry. Usually I take my time and go really slow. After the fact I realized I was bleeding a little bit more than usual. I waited a few minutes and I wiped the blood away and that's when I noticed I had two puncture marks. I thought I had only pierced myself once. From the sneeze I must have moved up a millimeter. Now I'm scared of a blood infection. I have severe anxiety and this kind of thing will just eat away at me. I do feel a bit nauseous but that could just be because I push the plunger down pretty fast. It's been an hour and I don't feel anything except for a little nauseous and dizzy. Nothing I haven't experienced from just being too impatient with my stelara in the past. But has anybody else accidentally poke themselves twice with the same needle? Did you get a blood infection? Has anybody gotten a blood infection from there injections? Does anybody know what I should really look out for? The internet is extremely vague and it is past the time where I can call my doctor.

250,Stelara,"6 year old admitted to PCICU in heart failure 48 hrs post first Remicade infusion, I’m freaking out. 😭💔","Hi all, first post here but I am looking for anyone else who may have experienced this, or any experiences or support you all may have. 

My 6 year old was diagnosed in mid June, after an ER visit led to a hospitalization for blood transfusions and endoscopy/colonoscopy/MRE. She was given a few days of IV steroids, and then we were discharged a week later on a Prednisone taper. During that admission, they also decided to start her on Remicade, which we had to wait around a month (until now) to start due to pre-testing and insurance clearance. Thankfully, the Prednisone has been an absolute godsend and she has been doing great this past month. 

She just had her first Remicade on Tuesday morning, and everything went well except for some sleepiness afterwards. Thursday morning, she woke up with chest pain and trouble breathing, which concerned me enough to bring her in to our pediatrician. They were immediately concerned (after vitals and just seeing her), and called an ambulance to take her in to the children’s hospital ER. These past couple of days have been such a a traumatic nightmare, more than I can possibly describe. An ultrasound in the ER confirmed “hypersensitivity myocarditis,” (heart inflammation), and she was transferred up to PCICU (cardiac intensive care unit). They placed a PICC line, and started her on a cocktail of intense IV medications (Milrinone, Lasix, Epinephrine, Heparin, fluids, etc) to support her heart, and we also have her on high flow oxygen. These have, thankfully, taken her from near death to now currently stable, although still in very critical condition. I am posting here because both the IBD and cardiology teams have confirmed with us as of a few hours ago that this was Remicade induced, and now they’ll plan to start her on something else as soon as we can get her heart under control. We discussed possibly Entyvio or Stelara, and we also met with the general surgery team today to talk about the possibility of a bowel resection that could save her from starting a new biologic for a while, with very close monitoring of her Crohn’s obviously. If she deteriorates again, then they will take her straight to the OR for a VAD (ventricular assist device), possibly ECMO, and immediately list her status 1A for a heart transplant. Best case scenario is she continues to stabilize, we wean her from the IV to oral medications, and then send her home with close follow up from the heart failure team. I cannot even believe that Remicade put her in near death condition, and way worse off than when she was even first diagnosed. I feel so incredibly guilty for letting them give it to her, like what a horrible mother am I that these are practically my actions that did this to my daughter. She is the light of my life and I just want the best for her, I am still in shock that this is even happening because she has just been doing SO well this past month (ever since the first hospitalization that gave her the Crohn’s diagnosis), even though it’s temporary and steroid-induced.

Anyway — if you read this, thank you. Sorry if this scares anyone, we are being told this is a very rare side effect. I’m just really spiraling right now, and could use some support.",2025-07-26 06:58:05,CrohnsDisease,247,1m9msyg,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m9msyg/6_year_old_admitted_to_pcicu_in_heart_failure_48/,2025-07-26
251,Stelara,Is there no cure for gastroparesis?,"I was first diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 10 years ago. Since then, except for experiencing bowel obstruction and abdominal pain once or twice a year, I have remained in a prolonged asymptomatic phase, with normal findings on blood tests, endoscopy, and no subjective symptoms.

About 2 to 3 years ago, an endoscopy revealed a fibrotic stricture in the ileocecal region, but I continued to experience little to no symptoms afterward.

However, starting a few months ago, I began to experience significant delayed gastric emptying. After eating, I feel as though food stays in my stomach for up to 8 hours, accompanied by a mild sensation of nausea. Currently, aside from the gastroparesis and the stricture, I have no other symptoms, and my inflammatory markers are normal.

As for my medication, I have only been taking the immunosuppressant azathioprine since my initial diagnosis. I received my first Stelara injection a month ago.

252,Stelara,How do I know if my biologic treatment working?,"I just completed my 5th dose of Finlius (a biosimilar to Stelara) and after 40 weeks I feel like I’ve had very minor symptom relief. My GI said it can take up to 8 months to know for sure but I feel like at this stage I’m losing hope. 
For context: I have a tricky case of Crohn’s because it consistently presents abnormally. It went undiagnosed for a long time because I tend to err on the side of constipation. In 2023 I had my first colonoscopy which found ulceration in my TI, but pathology was negative so the doc dismissed it. In March 2024 I had an MRI which showed clear inflammation in my TI, leading to my diagnosis. 
I was on budesonide for 12 weeks and saw decent improvement but was still symptomatic. I did another colonoscopy which my GI said looked completely clean yet pathology came back positive for inflammation throughout my large intestine. I was then put on a 5ASA which only made me feel worse - and then the biologic. 
My main symptoms remain consistent - severe abdominal pain, blood in stool, nausea, and constipation for 5+ days followed by a day of nonstop trips to the bathroom. 
I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like nothing will ever make me feel better.

255,Stelara,Crohn’s disease and kidney,"Hi everyone,

My wife was recently diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, and her doctor started her on Remicade. It’s been about four months now, and overall, the treatment has been going well — her symptoms have improved significantly.

However, I’m a bit concerned about a recent lab result. Her serum creatinine has increased from 0.72 to 0.92 mg/dL over the past few months. I know this is still within the normal range, but the upward trend worries me, especially since kidney issues, although rare, can sometimes be linked to biologics like Remicade.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Could this be a side effect of the medication? I’m also wondering if it’s possible or advisable to switch to a different biologic, like Entyvio or Stelara, which I’ve read may have fewer systemic effects.

We’re planning to follow up with her GI and possibly a nephrologist, but I’d really appreciate any input or shared experiences from the community in the meantime.

260,Stelara,Jackfruit Incident &amp; Dealing with Intense Pain - Anyone Else Relate?,"Hey everyone,

Just had a pretty rough experience today and wanted to reach out to see if anyone else has similar struggles or advice.

After about three years, I decided to try two pieces of jackfruit today. My usual lunch followed. About two hours later, my stomach started hurting intensely. It was this pulsing pain, coming every 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Honestly, in between waves, I was regretting eating it and just feeling utterly miserable. I took dicyclomine, but it didn't even touch the pain.

After about 4-5 hours of this struggle, I drank two large glasses of water, which finally induced vomiting. Thankfully, that brought complete relief and I'm pain-free now.
I know Crohn's is so different for everyone, but has anyone else experienced similar long-lasting, intense pain sessions like this? And if so, how do you manage them? Except for one time this past April, vomiting usually brings me relief.

I was in remission for a year until April, and I think I'm still in a flare-up now. I'm continuing Stelara every 4 weeks. My GI confirmed no antibodies, but low levels of the medicine, which is why we changed the interval from 8 to 4 weeks.

Normally, I stick to my comfort foods and for months I can almost forget I have Crohn's. But when a flare-up hits like this, it takes a huge mental toll on me for the next month, and I inevitably lose weight. Historically, I should be totally fine by tomorrow morning, but I don't want to jinx it.

261,Stelara,"CRS is jumping the gun, or am I crazy?","Long story short, last May, I started showing symptoms of Crohn’s after being relatively well managed for 4 years. 

They put me on Steroids, but it turns out I also had C Diff - Also, in May I had developed a rectal ulcer independent of Crohn’s (Won’t go into details, but I know this was independent of Crohn’s) 

Over the course of 2024, I fought C Diff 3 times, and we swapped me to a new biologic - Today, I’m down to 2.5mg of Pred. And Stelara every 8 weeks. I’m having two BMs a day, and can eat generally what I want, just avoiding super fibrous veggies - I’m still fighting the Rectal Ulcer though, and, it’s painful every day. 

I asked for an appt with my CRS, to look at surgical options for the Ulcer. My ask is to have a temporary Ileostomy while we allow that to heal, and we can also get rid of the structure I currently have where my small meets my large. 

My CRS only offered solution is a total Proctectomy. I’m a little upset at this, as I’m currently a very healthy weigh, I excercise, I eat 3 meals a day, and I have good bloodwork. I just am fighting the ulcer, it’s upsetting, to me, that he just wants to “end medical management” of my Crohn’s. 

Does anybody else have this experience with CRS wanting to just jump straight to the most severe option? It’s doubly frustrating, as, I haven’t had a colonoscopy since 8/24, and also have hemmorhoid, I haven’t had blood in my stool for months and there’s a chance that I’m just fighting a hemmorhoid, at this point.

If you have Skyrizi at 4 weeks, could you comment your experience and where you live so I can build a case to try to up my dosage? Any advice welcomed. Thank you! 

Update: Thank you all for your responses. I was extremely taken aback by them and had to sit with some intense grief over the idea that I could’ve gotten the dosage I needed 2 years ago and not pooped blood for the past entire year if I lived somewhere else. I’m in the process of trying to get 4 weeks approved and if they say no, I may move out of state to receive what I need. There’s only one medication left on the market at the moment (Tremfya) that does what Skyrizi does (I also failed Stelara because of a dosage issue) and I’m not taking any chances of failing the a third IL-23 inhibitor because my insurance company doesn’t want to give me the dosage I need to stay in remission. This disease is hell, but dealing with insurance sometimes feels even worse. Thank you again for your help.

263,Stelara,Starting Rinvoq - looking for reassurance/advice,"Hey all,

My GI has determined that I've failed Infliximab (in combination with Imuran). We discussed Stelara  + Imuran or Rinvoq to replace it, and I felt like the fast nature of how it works + a daily pill that didn't involve setting aside time every 2 months for an infusion or injection seemed like the better option. My doctor said it was up to me but just started moving forward with prescribing Rinvoq when I made my feelings known. 

She said it's possible the medication could start relieving symptoms within a few days.

I'm going to get a Shingles vaccine (I actually got Shingles a few months ago) and bloodwork, and then should start taking the daily pills as soon as the pharmacy has them ready for me.

I've seen a lot of folks mention the acne and my GI mentioned higher cholesterol. Does anyone have suggestions of ways to mitigate these side effects? 

Any experiences you can share with this medication?

I'm cautiously optimistic that I now have a new treatment that can address my disease, which has been flaring for almost a year now.",2025-06-26 17:36:25,CrohnsDisease,3,1ll6d75,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ll6d75/starting_rinvoq_looking_for_reassuranceadvice/,2025-06-26
264,Stelara,In need for advise and insights,"Hi everyone,

I’m 30 and was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in **September 2024**. Since then, it’s been quite a ride – physically and mentally – and I’m looking for insights, shared experiences, and maybe a bit of guidance from this community.

***Journey so far:***

**October 2024** \- I started a cortisone treatment (Medrol) in  which is still ongoing. Here’s how it went:

* 32mg: I felt extremely wired, couldn’t sleep, constantly restless
* 24mg: still quite ""high"" and agitated
* 16mg: stable and mostly symptom-free
* 8mg: symptoms came back – diarrhea, pain, cramps, sleepless nights due to pain

**January and February 2025** \- I went on a cycling trip around Taiwan – which was a personal milestone. It helped me rebuild trust in my body and mentally gave me the space to feel free again, not defined by the disease.

**February 2025** \- After the trip, I started tapering the cortisone and introduced Stelara (chosen because of the 8-week interval – I want to keep traveling long-term). Unfortunately, each attempt to taper Medrol brought back symptoms.

**May 2025** \- I received my second Stelara injection, but I’m still on 16mg Medrol daily.

**June 2025** \-  I experienced a flare-up – likely due to poor Medrol management (I went a weekend without taking it properly) and a tough emotional period. The usual symptoms came rushing back: cramps, diarrhea, pain. I have a hospital appointment this week to reassess my treatment – possibly adjusting the biologic.

***What I’m struggling with:***

* I have a busy and demanding job (in the cultural / artistic field as a manager), and a very active social life.
* So far, I haven’t made any lifestyle changes: no dietary adjustments, still go out, still travel as much as possible.
* But I’m starting to wonder if this is sustainable – and how I can create a calmer, more stable way of living without giving up the parts of life that energize me.
* I struggle with understanding and trusting the limits of my body ↔ mentally. Doing 'less' feels as 'failing'.

***Some questions:***

* Has anyone here managed Stelara + cortisone tapering successfully? Any tips? Looking for alternatives atm together with my doctor.
* How do you balance an active life with the need for rest, especially with work pressure?
* Have any of you found real benefits from changing your diet or lifestyle – without going extreme or restrictive?
* How do you continue to travel adventurously or make long-term plans, despite the uncertainty Crohn’s brings?

Right now, I feel very uncertain about summer (I had plans for a trip), and I’m scared of another flare-up while far from home or a hospital. 

Any insights, tips, or shared experiences would mean a lot. ❤️ Thank you for reading!",2025-06-23 11:12:30,CrohnsDisease,2,1lidv3d,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lidv3d/in_need_for_advise_and_insights/,2025-06-23
266,Stelara,Stelara Vs Tremfya,"Hi everyone!

I have been on Stelara for the better part of 8 years. I have handled it well and have achieved “optical remission.” Based on my last scope / biopsies, my GI believes that I can achieve deep remission by switching to Skyrizi or Tremfya since I have some underlying inflammation despite having a clean blood work bill and a decent weight. 

I chose Tremfya simply for the fact that I don’t want to have to sit through 3 series’ of infusions before I can begin injections. Especially since there was a hiccup during my reinduction dose of Stelara with insurance. 

So. My question is. Has anyone went from stelara to Tremfya? What are your reviews? Even if you didn’t start with stelara, I’d still like to hear about your experience. I’m nervous starting this new regimen because I had such good luck with stelara.

He then switched to Remicade while getting his undergrad degree from WSU. That is until he graduated and started working at a Veterinary clinic at age 22, where last Thanksgiving he had a flare and ended up needing emergency gastrointestinal surgery in Seattle. He’s now on Lialda, accepted and plans to go to St. George’s Veterinary graduate school in Grenada in January 2026. I am now early retired due to my own GI health issues and longer have health insurance coverage for him or myself. He currently has health insurance coverage through his work and will have student insurance coverage while in school overseas. His Dr.’s did a colonoscopy yesterday and say it's now progressed to Crohn's and they want him on Stelara. But that appears to not be covered by his student insurance overseas.

277,Stelara,Doctor said next steps are surgery not changing medications again. Looking for advice/your experiences,"Hi, (26f, USA here) so I have been diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease since 2017/2018. It took me about 2 years to get a diagnosis, as my symptoms started at 2015/2016 but I wasn’t like finally diagnosed and starting treatment till winter of 2018. I have in this time maybe been in remission a year to a year and a half, I have been on at least 40mg daily of prednisone for about 5 years total in the 7/8 years, with my longest stents being on them for 2 years continuously (bad GI doc during covid and finally switched) and now 9 months straight. I have failed remicade, inflectra, rinvoque(I think is how you spell it idk don’t butcher me), humara, stelara, and am currently on and failing entivyo. The remicade/inflectra seemed to be the only thing keeping away the anal fistulas/fissures as well as the other medications just let them come back at full force. 


I recently saw my doctor just a few days ago as a recheck to see if the entivyo was finally kicking in/working and sadly it isn’t. I asked my doctor what the next steps are here, like changing meds, more frequent meds, etc.   He said that I have pretty much failed every medication, and have not be able to get into remission, and he wants me to start mentally preparing as the next step he is recommending is a colostomy (he said they know they will want to remove at least the left half of my colon, however when we speak with the surgeon we may just remove my entire colon) as well as removing my like rectum and butthole (sorry not sure the proper term for this surgery) as I keep having peri-anal symptoms of the disease like fissures/fistualas.   

He is sending me to get another opinion for another crohns doctor that he trusts/recommends to ensure that there isn’t another option that maybe he isn’t thinking of, and wants me to go meet with the surgeon just to start preparing. 


So yeah, my life just kinda flipped upside down as this was not what I was expecting, and I don’t even know where to begin, so if this lovely community would like to share your personal experiences maybe that are similar to this, what can I expect, how much will my life change, that would be amazing! Just anything you think I should know, maybe things you learned that no one told you that you think others should know. I’m just still trying to process it all.

279,Stelara,Are Biologics Overkill In This Case?,"Four years ago I was having some symptoms that made me pretty miserable and prevented me from eating much. I had bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain/cramping. I went to a GI specialist who eventually did a colonoscopy. I was told it looked like early Crohn's due to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum. The biopsies didn't identify any inflammation though. Inflammatory markers on stool test where only slightly elevated, making the situation more ambiguous. When symptoms acted up, I'd do a round of budesonide (about every year). At that time I was shocked and overwhelmed by even the tentative diagnosis and treatment which I posted about here some time back.

Very recently, I had a second colonoscopy after the reoccurrence of symptoms. The doctor said they found what the first colonoscopy found and noted to me that it ""didn't really look that bad"". This time a biopsy actually revealed signs of inflammation that a pathologist could see. On the other hand, my CT scan came back perfectly fine. I'm pretty fed up being in diagnostic limbo for years, even if my symptoms are fairly occasional and mild (and perhaps haven't progressed much in those 4 years). I've tried Mesalmine and while it works for some people apparently, I'm not convinced it's effective for me.

 I have a followup in a couple days and I'm hoping I'll have a diagnosis. If so, I'm leaning towards asking about starting Stelara which apparently has a good safety profile, but I'm wondering if I've gone from being too timid to too aggressive about treatment. My question is whether biologics would make sense in this situation or whether it might be overkill. I used to be afraid of the treatment and think of it as ""worse than the disease"" but at this point I'd rather address it than have the annoyance of intermittent corticosteroid use. Since most people here are more knowledgeable than me in terms of first hand experience, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a comparable situation and how they handled it or even just their thoughts/advice on all this.",2025-05-12 20:47:59,CrohnsDisease,3,1kl3k6p,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kl3k6p/are_biologics_overkill_in_this_case/,2025-05-12

I've read that in Europe surgery is often used sooner than in the US, with good outcomes.  Also it seems like seeing a naturopath for complimentary medicine is much more affordable. 

I'm currently on Stelara,  eligible for surgery due to a stricture in my ileum, but not sure if I should proceed with surgery or try to treat SIBO that's plaguing me to reduce symptoms.  

I've read that Spain has one of the best medical systems in Europe and it is towards the top of our list for moving to.

My biggest thing is I am tired all the time, and I eat but don't gain weight. I am 38yrs old. Have any of you had a similar experience with Crohn's? Just looking for any similar experience.

I'll be moving through a work visa, and he'll come by as a dependent.

\- Has anyone moved to Poland and had to get Crohn's medication for yourself or your loved one? How was the experience?  
\- Does Poland have health insurance that covers Crohn's disease costs? Maybe the national healthcare does this job?

My hemoglobin went below a 5, I lost 40+ lbs due to zero appetite, I was feverish constantly, nauseous and withering away. I couldn’t walk because the abscess (I didn’t know was there) was crushing my femoral nerve.

My surgeon later said there were multiple fistulas from my ileum and cecum so I ended up having a double small bowel resection and then a full Ileocecectomy in January (two different surgeries 3 weeks apart).

299,Stelara,Advice on HRV &amp; Enterovirus,"Hello, I am a 20M diagnosed with Crohn’s for 7 years. For the past week I’ve been coughing and had runny nose but unable to cough out any mucus. Along with that, I recently had many occurrences of diarrhea (some with strands of blood), which led me to be admitted to a hospital.

During my stay, my diarrhea frequency has died down mostly likely due to not eating as much and not having to use too much energy. When they did a swab test for Covid, they tested me positive for HRV and Enterovirus. After a day of admission, the GI team was willing to discharge me with no additional medications.

I’m pretty young so I’m not that experience in terms of when I should expect to receive medication, but I’m guessing there aren’t exact medications to help recover faster for Enterovirus &amp; HRV other than remedies to help relieve. 

I am currently on two biological treatments for my Crohn’s, Stelara and Xeljanz (Tofacitinib) which weakens my immune system, making it harder for me to recover faster. I was wondering if anybody has advice on just recovering because it’s hard having an uncontrollable diarrhea while attending college.

I’ve also tried taking over the counter medication like Tylenol for my cough and cough drops, which doesn’t really seem to help.

So after surgery and stelara in July my life’s been steadily improving. Started my own tutoring business, been running and to the gym regularly, trying new foods, went on holidays etc.

On Saturday I had an over ambitious plate of vegetables and ended up with a partial obstruction. Vomiting and pain for 12hrs. Not my first rodeo though. The next day my girlfriend broke up with me.

Now my stomach still feels uncomfortable especially if poked, I’ve got heinous diarrhea, a bloodshot eye, what looks like mild oral thrush, I’m not sleeping more than 4hrs a night.

It’s really hard to disentangle how much is emotional turmoil, how much is consequences from a food my post surgical bowels couldn’t handle, how much is an active flair or a combination of the above. Should I push ahead with running and the gym? Try to force some food in? Should I be looking into tests for a flare or is this expected?

305,Stelara,Entyvio maintenance phase and skin condition…,"I was diagnosed in April of 2024. My first three GI doctors had me on Stelara until I lost my insurance after being let go from work. I was sick nonstop from colds and flu bugs and it didn’t help my gut pain whatsoever, so it was a blessing that it didn’t last long. 

After some trial and error I finally found a doctor that gave me options and we ended up choosing Entyvio. I had preloading IV’s at four week intervals from last November up until last week. With each infusion I found life to be more comfortable with two exceptions. 

1- I have had the most issues with major hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding. Not to mention constant itching but it’s manageable. 

2- my skin burns and peels like I have a constantly reoccurring sunburn. Lotion, even goat milk lotion, makes it worse. I scrub the dead skin away and have even asked my teenage daughter for skin care tips but none have really helped. 

After speaking with my doctor today, she said the two reactions are common in only 3% of patients taking Entyvio for CD. 

My question to all of you is, have you had a similar reaction and if so, what helped.

309,Stelara,"Stelara, side effects and changing drugs","**Hi!** 

My doctors are trying to move me to Stelara from my current drug Infliximab. 

Ive been on infliximab since I was 14 and I am currently 19. Its been great but I have horrific psoriasis which I have gone to the dermatologist for. I was told to take Sotokyu, which then gave me acne. Then I was told to take accutane… and so on - it was a mess! And to be honest with you, although I live in Australia and I am so grateful for our healthcare, I can not afford to go to the dermatologist or pay for any new medications since I am incharge of my personal health bills. 

For previous history, I developed Rheumatoid arthritis on Salazopyrine when I was 13, which is why I am nervous about starting stelara. I have heard that joint pain is a side affect and I can not go through that again - it was traumatic! I also run nearly every day and I dance a lot too. Being active is my way of staying happy and ultimately controlling my disease. 

My mum also passed away from melanoma. I have heard there is increased risk of melanoma on this medication. Since her cancer was brought on by a specific gene, I am a bit nervous. 

My doctors feel that this drug is the safest alternative to Infliximab. 

The change has been brought on by a recent mini flair (most likely being brought on by travelling).

318,Stelara,Two viruses in two weeks (on Stelera),"So, I’ve been dealing with Crohn’s and am on Stelara, which already makes my gut unpredictable. But this past week has been a ride. I somehow managed to get hit with two separate viruses within days of each other, and both times, I ended up vomiting bile after hours of nausea.

First Virus (2/4-2/6):
	•	Started with mild nausea and bloating.
	•	Woke up at 2:30 AM and proceeded to puke every 30 minutes for 8 hours straight.
	•	The next day, I was completely wiped out, could barely move, and had periodic diarrhea.
	•	Water made my bloating worse, and I could only lay on my left side.
	•	No BMs for the next two days, then a rollercoaster of weird bowel movements followed.

Second Virus (2/17):
	•	Fatigue hit me like a truck (10/10). Sinus pain and nausea throughout the day. No BMs.
	•	By 5:30 PM, I threw up bile again—but unlike last time, it actually gave me relief for a few hours. Unfortunately I’m back to being miserable today after a night of horrific body aches.

I know bile vomiting can happen when your stomach is empty, but this pattern is bizarre. Has anyone else experienced this with back-to-back illnesses? Could the Stelara be making viral infections hit me harder, or is my gut just completely losing its ability to regulate?

Would love to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences. I messaged my GI and he doesn’t seem concerned, but I’m scared. I’ve never experienced illness like this before.

I was on Stelara injections every 8 weeks then was no longer working so done it more frequently every 4 weeks to see how that goes but unfortunately still no longer worked.

323,Stelara,Skin Problems,"So, back in August above t two weeks after an infliximab infusion, I got a strange rash on my upper chest. I thought it was folliculitis, because I had it happen before, and this looked similar. Went to urgent care, was prescribed the antibiotics that helped before, but it didn't go away. We tried another round of antibiotics, we tried an antifungal ointment, and neither of those things work, so I made an appointment with my dermatologist. Just before my next Remicade infusion, it appeared to subside. Two weeks later, the rash showed up in new places mostly on my legs and abdomen. I saw my PCP who questioned it being a reaction to Remicade. I saw my GI doctor, who agreed the Remicade could potentially be causing it, but she suggested I keep my appointment with dermatology and get a skin biopsy. I saw derm, and she didn't think a biopsy was necessary. She thought it was most likely eczema. She prescribed triamcinolone ointment. That seemed to clear it up before I had another Remicade infusion, but once again, two weeks later the rash came back. I messaged my dermatologist and started using the ointment again, but it was like playing wack-a-mole bc new spots kept popping up. This time the dermatologist wanted to do a biopsy. Biopsy showed folliculitis, no bacterial infection, no virus, no fungus. Because I am pregnant, my dermatologist did not want to continue the steroid ointment, and I was prescribed clindamycin and told to use benzoyl peroxide wash. It only got worse. Red, bumpy, scaly, dry, extremely itchy. At this point the rash was all over my back, chest, torso, legs, and on my neck and scalp. The dermatologist said I could again try the triamcinolone for just a week. It cleared a lot up, but there were still new bumps, lots of red, scaley patches, and old spots reappeared, so she had me do one more week. After that week, it looked a lot better, not completely gone, but again, due to pregnancy, we stopped. It's been a week, and it is getting bad again. 

I am getting so frustrated. It's been months now of not having normal, clear skin. We still don't know for sure what it is. Last time I saw my dermatologist, she said that she thinks it's a mix of folliculitis and eczema, and to just use lots of moisturizer, which is doing nothing to help, and the rash continues to get worse. I have tried to do as much research as I can online, and I keep finding that psoriasis matches my experience, but my dermatologist has never even mentioned it... and I feel like psoriasis isn't so rare that it would be overlooked, but the rash is just SO persistent. It goes away to an extent with the steroid, but comes right back when we stop the steroid. My GI doctor discontinued Remicade and is trying to get auth for Stelara. 

I don't even know what specifically to ask about anymore. I'm just at the point where I am upset that I'm halfway through a pregnancy and can't relax and enjoy and look at my bump and have the kind of appreciation that I did with my body during my previous pregnancy. I feel like I'm getting robbed of the experience. I'm tired of what I see when I look in the mirror. I'm tired of worrying. I'm tired of false hope. I just want to know what is going on, and how I stop it... or if I can stop it. Or do I have to live with it forever. 

Does anyone know what this is, or where I even go from this point to try to figure it out?",2025-01-28 20:58:26,CrohnsDisease,2,1icc4uh,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1icc4uh/skin_problems/,2025-01-28

326,Stelara,"taking stelara for the 2nd time, looking for similar experiences","Hey friends, 

So I first took Stelara about 5-6 years ago. I was on it for a few years and stopped, switched to Rinvoq, which was a horrible experience (that's a story for another time.) Doctor switched me to Skyrizi, but 2 months ago I went into a terrible flare that just won't go away. We decided the best option was to go back on the Stelara.

I went for my infusion yesterday, definitely not thinking that anything crazy might happen. Well 10 minutes into the infusion, I got chest tightness, couldn't breathe, heart rate/bp went way up, that kind of a reaction. The nurse stopped it immediately, gave me benadryl plus a bag of IV fluids, and said she couldn't attempt to finish the infusion. 

Has anyone been on Stelara before, gone off for a few years and started again? I just don't understand because I handled it fine before. The *only* possible thing I can think of is that when I got it the first time years ago, I'm 80% sure they gave me a ""just in case"" benadryl before starting it. 

Any advice is appreciated!",2025-01-23 15:01:49,CrohnsDisease,3,1i85a6l,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1i85a6l/taking_stelara_for_the_2nd_time_looking_for/,2025-01-23

330,Stelara,Kinda lost...,"Hi all,

Just need to get this off my chest....sorry for the long post.

I have perianal crohns and my journey has been so whack. All of my symptoms are localized to my rectal area so I don't have the typical crohns symptoms like diarrhea. I do have urgency though and not feeling fully emptied. Ive had several I&amp;D, fissurectomy and and a fistulotomy. I was on remicade, then inflectra (2022-dec 2024). My infusions basically stopped being effective around 4 months ago. I started getting mild symptoms again, lots of bright red blood, passing blood clots, mucus, weird looking stool, and urgency. I was in remission for a while so I forgot how anxiety inducing not knowing where the nearest bathroom is. Anyway, I was at urgent care one day for an unrelated crohns issue and thought what the hell, let me tell the Dr about my symptoms. She told me to go to the ER. I go to the ER and they admit me. They do all these blood tests and everything is elevated. The hospital GI comes and talks to me and is unimpressed with my perianal symptoms and keeps asking me if I'm having any of the intestinal crohns issues which I'm not having. I get an enterography and it shows proctitis. I got discharged before they even gave me the fucking MRI results. It was so fucked up, they didn't do anything for me. They didn't give me anything post discharge. I scheduled a colonoscopy that confirmed proctitis but this was the first time since 2022 that I've had any symptoms. No one was listening to me when I was saying that I don't feel the effects of inflectra anymore. I meet with a different GI and they do an infliximab levels &amp; antibody test and everything is fine? 🥲 No idea why it wasn't working anymore. Anyway, I got switched to stelara and I don't notice any difference. I got my loading stelara infusion about 3 weeks ago and nothing. 

The last like 3 weeks I started getting pain in my rectal area and it felt so inflamed. There was a new bump. I worried that I had an abscess. I go see a CRS (well, an NP in the CRS dept - she's great tho) and she says she sees a fistula. I broke down in the office. She sent me to do another enterography. The enterography shows NOTHING - no abscess, no fistula, no proctitis. I'm perfectly fine 🥲👍🏼 there was a ton of inflammation and I was actively bleeding during the rectal exam. When the NP called me to tell me that the MRI didn't show anything, she was confused too because she examined me! Something is up! This is how my journey has been, I have all these symptoms but there's no explanation for anything. I thought I was over this but of course there will always be flares. It's easy to get carried away when you feel good. 

I feel like doctors don't care about your symptoms until you're having severe debilitating symptoms. I could feel my symptoms worsening and tried to be a step ahead but of course, no one took me seriously. 

I told my GI and she told me to inject every 4 weeks instead of 8. I'm honestly really scared of getting worse. The pain and suffering that I experienced for those years leading up to finally starting remicade was pure hell. I was at the CRS office every 2 weeks back then. So many instruments have been up my ass, it's unreal!!!! It was a fucking nightmare. I was so happy when infliximab was working and I'm terrified that it stopped being effective for me even when I didn't develop antibodies? When it worked, it was a miracle drug for me. I was used to it working right away so the stelara not really doing much is concerning. 

Wow this has become so long. Sorry. I just feel scared and lost.

Does anyone else experience symptoms but are told that you're perfectly fine? I feel insane.

333,Stelara,Psoriasis from Remicade,"Hi guys!

I have had Crohn’s for about 9 years and have been on infliximab (Inflectra/Remicade) infusions for 7 years. I was just diagnosed with psoriasis after noticing a skin rash I would guess I’ve had for about a year (not sure exactly). 

The derm pathology report said “psoriaform dermatitis.” My derm said she’s pretty confident it’s psoriasis, but because of the rash location, it’s not possible to get a definite psoriasis diagnosis. 

Her treatment regime recommendation is topical steroid cream. But, I hate steroids and am terrified of topical steroid withdrawal (TSW). If the psoriasis is due to Remicade (side effect) then that could be reason enough to switch meds — at least for insurance. 

I would hate to disrupt my \~6 year remission since I had surgery. I am a little turned off by my GI’s enthusiasm to change meds, especially because Remicade has worked so well. He had this same enthusiasm before he knew about the rash…

On the other hand, I was all for switching to the infliximab injection (Zymfentra) that was FDA approved Oct 2023. That was until my insurance denied it (love insurance don’t we :). However, I am more hesitant to switch to a completely different med because of the risk of a flare. 

I would love to hear others’ experiences with switching meds due to psoriasis (my GI would have me do Skyrizi because it has been shown to be more effective than Stelara, he said). 

Also thoughts on my GI’s encouragement to switch meds despite my remission? 

I appreciate all your responses!",2025-01-11 02:46:38,CrohnsDisease,1,1hym6ev,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hym6ev/psoriasis_from_remicade/,2025-01-11
334,Stelara,How long until you got treatment? ,"I got diagnosed with Crohn's disease in June 2024 and was immediately put on Entocort (Budesonide). After the first round of steroids wasn't enough to put me into remission, my gastro decides to put me on a waitlist to get the Stelara Infusion. 

While waiting, I get an MRI done, where they find an internal fistula. My gastro takes me off the stelara waitlist and puts me on the waitlist for Infliximab, in order to not only treat the inflammation but also the fistula. 

Fast forward to today: The public health system sucks and I'm still waiting to get proper treatment. My gastro is keeping me on Entocort which is not helping much, while I'm waiting to hear back from the hospital. 

It's been an odyssey and I'm just so so tired. I feel left alone and abandoned by the health system, while wondering if it's even safe for me to be left untreated for MONTHS. From my understanding, it can be quite dangerous to leave moderate-severe crohns disease basically untreated for such a long time. I'm worried about the potential long-term effects. 

Is it normal to wait that long until you receive proper treatment? What have your experiences been? Any words of encouragement are highly appreciated 🫶🏼",2025-01-08 22:51:20,CrohnsDisease,17,1hwxfvx,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hwxfvx/how_long_until_you_got_treatment/,2025-01-08

338,Stelara,Vitamins and supplements,"Looking for some thoughts and feedback on vitamins and supplements. Over the past several years, bloodwork showing deficiencies has resulted in me going on a multivitamin (2 a day for full dosage) B-12 (1 a day) and D3 (label recommends 2 a day, but take 1 a day since I'm also on the multivitamin) I also started taking Neuriva over a year ago as I don't quite feel as sharp as I age, (side note on that: didn't feel any difference when I started taking it, but when my local store was out of stock for over a month, I did notice a clear difference coming off of it) I was also taking magnesium citrate, which helped with joint pain, but stopped that about a month ago when I did additional research after seeing a discussion recommending it for managing constipation. Constipation is definitely not an issue for me. I spread taking everything throughout the day both for more gradual absorption and to not hammer my gut with everything at once. Gummies for the multivitamin and B-12, caplet for the D3, hoping for form with maximum absorption for the short time it has passing through me.

Current status is second home application of Skyrizzi will be next week, November was the first one after the infusion starters; have seen only minor improvement since switching after the Stelara stopped working. Long story short (I know, too late) about a week ago, going to a friend's house for the day, I forgot to take anything in the morning and didn't bring anything with me, ended up taking all of my supplements when I got home around 6:30, and around 10:30pm turned out to be the start of a rough night. Testing a theory, I cut out all of the supplements for 3 days and went from 2 to 1 cups of coffee a day. On days 2 &amp; 3, movements were still slow in coming and still very wet when they occurred, but total movements were 2-3 total for the day, and morning only, which is close to as manageable as my symptoms get since starting biologics. Started the supplements back up on Wednesday, (still keeping to single cup of coffee) and it's been 4-6 movements a day, including morning, afternoon and evening.

2 questions: 1. Any thoughts on how to get the nutrients I need? Am I wrong to think gummy form is the way to go? I know things don't spend long in my body, so I need quick absorption, but does anyone have experience with forms that are both gentle and quick absorption? 2. From what I've been able to find, magnesium glycinate does not have the stool softening effects of magnesium citrate, plus it's cited to help with some of my other issues, including fatigue, anxiety, stress, and depression. Does anyone have any experience with magnesium glycinate?",2025-01-03 19:36:14,CrohnsDisease,4,1hsuxd3,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hsuxd3/vitamins_and_supplements/,2025-01-03
339,Stelara,My first post here,"Hey everyone, this will be my first post on here. I was diagnosed with Crohn's in October, after some CT scans and endoscopy/colonoscopy. I was immediately put on Prednisone to fight it, and it was working until I had a flare-up, which for me was severe bloating and overall discomfort. It did go away after a week or so of doing a BRAT diet, but returned with a vengeance on Thanksgiving, which was worse, with fluids coming out of both ends pretty much at the same time. But again, after a few days of being very careful, it went away. I started tapering off the steroids in preparation for my first Stelara infusion on December 5th, and two days after, the flare returned, and this time it didn't go away. I came to the hospital on the 19th and immediately had an NG tube put in. After four days of suction with no real slowdown, they suggested surgery, and on Monday, I had an ileocolic resection, and they also removed my appendix because, I guess, it gets in the way. Today, I'm still sitting here with the NG tube. My doctor doesn't like the amount of fluid it's still producing and wants me to have a bowel movement before it comes out. I'm farting, which is good, but I just don't understand where the bowel movement is going to come from if I haven't eaten anything in a week. Has anyone had any similar experiences?

In May 2024, doctors informed us that he now has Crohn's disease. In June, they tried treating him with infliximab, but within a week, he had an epileptic seizure and was diagnosed with CVT (cerebral venous thrombosis). Since then, he has been on anticoagulant medication. Unfortunately, infliximab did not work for him, so since September, the doctors started him on Stelara, but it also seems ineffective.

In November, he became infected with *Clostridium* and started experiencing severe diarrhea (6-8 times a day, with significant blood). He has been treated with vancomycin for this infection. Since November, he has been tested three times and treated repeatedly, but Stelara still does not seem to be working. His usual symptoms include bloody stools several times a day, though generally less than 8 times.

346,Stelara,Anyone ever experience just a constant waterfall of clear fluid from your butt?,"\*UPDATE: Ended up going to the ER on the advice of my primary care doctor. Was there all day, but at least I got an answer. Apparently I was infected by a stomach bug called Astrovirus that just wrecked me because of my crappy immune system. They rehydrated me and I should be better in a couple days. Thanks for everyone's support and answers. I'm feeling a little better today and the bone broth is helping to keep me from total exhaustion.\*

I'm on day 5 of some truly weird-ass (pun intended) symptoms and I'm hoping someone has some insight on what might be going on with me. Normally when I have a flare up I experience itching, burning, urgency, and loose but not watery bowl movements, so these symptoms are something totally new.

**Symptoms:** Nausea, stomach cramping, constant watery bowl movements (like every 10-15 minutes). I would estimate I'm losing something like 10-12 ounces of clear fluid every hour. Weirdly, my bowl movements don't seem to have really anything I eat in them, they're basically the same color and consistency of watery urine. I haven't been eating much, however, as it makes the symptoms much worse for about 12 hours afterwards (down to about 10% of my normal calorie intake right now).

**Things I've tried so far:** Immodium, Budesonide, Cipro, Flagyl (got the antibiotics from the urgent care yesterday). None seem to be having any impact. The doc at the urgent care thought it might be an infection of some sort but to be honest he seemed to just be guessing.

**Background:** Had Crohns for about 20 years. J-pouch surgery, on Stelara and in remission for the last four years. My last Stelara dose was a month late due to insurance fuckery.

347,Stelara,access to health care? ,"hi you guys,

in the comments of another thread we just discussed the different possibilities to “pick your doctor” in different countries. (as in: i don’t like my gastroenterologist or think they are unprofessional so i go to another one.) 

i would be interested how your situation is regarding this and regarding access to health care in general.

i live in berlin, germany. we have compulsory healthcare in germany. i have to pay around 8% out of my paycheck. when i’m unemployed the state pays that (out of tax money.) all my medical needs are covered by that, doctors visits, hospital stays, medicine.

berlin is the biggest city in germany so i have a choice of specialized doctors within reach. (i don’t have to drive longer than an hour.) they often have waiting lists and after diagnosis it took months to get an appointment. (it’s much easier if you have expensive private insurance.) but when i was in i was in. if i need care they can’t give, they call other doctors and help me to get appointments. a few months ago i had a horrible experience with a certain proctologist and within two days i found another proctologist with who i am very happy. all my medicine is paid for. (in my case right now that’s stelara.) mind you in more rural areas in germany the situation looks very different. 

of course our hospitals are severely underfunded, the staff is stressed as fuck because of that and the doctors are always overloaded with patients, there’s enough to rant about. but in comparison i do feel very lucky.

First of all this is my 1st post ever, hella nervous, so please go easy on me. :)

My story started back in May of 2023 with constant blood in stools and the beginnings of developing fissures and hemorrhoids. I also had mouth sores but at the time I just thought they were from stress. I would learn later that all of it was connected. Over the course of the year the blood got way worse. The pain, for lack of a better way of putting it, became multi-dimensional. I would give things names, like the ""Glass Shard Acorn"", which is a pain that sits in the center of my rectal area and feels like a giant acorn made of glass shards tearing apart my insides at all times with the smallest movement. I also have the ""Kool-Aid Man"", a constant painful intense pressure that feels like he is busting his way out from the inside of my large intestine. There is also the ""Aurora Borealis"", which feels like an electric current of pain that sweeps up and down my entire digestive track. 

Then of course there is the general pain when passing, first from the multiple fissures that feel like someone is running a knife and a flame thrower down my rectal area even with the softest and smallest anything when passing. It could be liquid, solid, semi-solid, doesn't matter. Last general pain was from hemorrhoids which would feel like a hundred or so needles sticking in and out when anything would come near them. At times there was this pool of blood pain that would activate more so in the morning, just earth shattering gut pain while passing pools of blood that filled the toilet. This would sometimes happen in middle of night, too. Eventually the pool of blood thing was constant right before I was admitted to hospital. 

Oh, and once there was this trauma pain that happened a week before I went to ER, when I had so much pain in passing my left eye popped, which later after tests with Ophthalmologist and then a Retina Specialist ended up being my retina detaching in my left eye. 

Also, right before being admitted it got to the point where I could barely walk. The frequency of bathroom trips got so bad I'd just give up and bring in a pillow and small blanket and curl up in the corner because there was no point in leaving.

My primary almost sent me to ER but had me take an iron test (knowing how much blood I had been passing) which came back within normal limits, and she knew I was two weeks away from seeing a specialist for the ""fissures and hemorrhoids"" which mind you at the time was our only collective understanding of my pain and problems, so no referral to hospital at that time. I was going to just ""tough it out"" for two more weeks. A week later I had had enough and went to the hospital. In part because I realized that I had started to choose to starve myself rather than eat which would be subjecting myself to pain and suffering, and that I had reached a point where the situation in general felt beyond absurd. I had to believe that someone somewhere would have an answer about what was happening to me, that it had to be more complicated than fissures and hemorrhoids or that if it was simply that maybe the version I had was off the charts and in need of special medication or?? 

I was almost turned away in ER when they learned I was about to see a specialist for fissures and hemorrhoids a week later, figuring that my issue was once again, singular, and not anything more complicated, but I asked the doctor on duty to PLEASE give me a scan, which came back with tons of inflammation and they admitted me to the main hospital straight away. 

I was in the hospital for another 10 days with the BEST doctors I have ever worked with in my entire life, was provided a much better understanding of what was happening to my body, and I was given a diagnosis of Crohn's disease very soon after my discharge. I included one test above that gives you a pretty good understanding of where I was at especially with inflammation while admitted. 

I just had my first infusion of Stelara (fingers crossed it works) and although I am still on high dose of steroids to keep my symptoms under control until the biologic kicks in, it feels good to be on the right path!

So, does anyone else out have a similar experience? Did you have to reach an insane level of pain and or suffering before you learned about or realized what it was you were dealing with?

358,Stelara,Does anybody know how late your Stelara dose can be before antibodies form?,"I made a post on Friday evening about how my Stelara shot came defective so I wasn't able to give myself my dose. Unfortunately it was the worst possible time for it to happen since the specialty pharmacy was already closed and they were only open a half-day on Saturday. I've spoken to them several times (each time getting different instructions on what to do ofc) and also talked to the manufacturer. The pharmacy told me it would be faster to do an override with insurance to get me a replacement dose instead of waiting on the manufacturer to send one, but that since I don't have any refills on file, I needed to contact my dr's office to get another refill first. I've been calling and messaging the office all day without answer so I'm assuming they're closed for Veteran's day.

Anyway, to make a long story short...does anyone have any experience with being late on a Stelara dose and know when it starts to get risky for another flare-up/antibodies forming? At this point I'm already three days late and I assume it will likely be at least another week until I can get this handled.

One of the pharmacists I spoke to said Stelara is one of the best meds to be late on since there's a bit more wiggle room than some of the other immunosuppressants, but he didn't really elaborate. I'm terrified my Crohn's is going to awaken from its 5 year slumber. Before Stelara I had a really aggressive case that led to years of surgery and agony and failing multiple medications and I really, really don't want to go through that again. I feel a bit sick/feverish today but I can't tell if it's from stress, Crohn's, or other issues (currently on antibiotics after dental work and it's that special time of month which always makes me feel lousy).

Appreciate any advice/insight/encouragement!

359,Stelara,Neuro &amp; Crohn's?,"Has anyone else put there experienced neuro symptoms with Crohn's?

I've been dealing with Crohn's for probably 4 years now - started with DR finding a stricture in 3rd part of duodenum...it was a good 2+ years later before another DR diagnosed it as Crohn's; inflammation never went away and the initial focus was just on dealing with that one stricture.

Weird-ish neuro symptoms started May 2023; I was hospitalized for severe iron deficiency, then sent to a few specialists. My neurologist ran A LOT of labs, scans, tests - eventually diagnosed it as long covid. But she only had 1 lab test that showed anything that couldn't be explained by Crohn's.

I'm on my 3rd biologic med (Stelara). Fortunately, Im not dealing with the usual Crohn's symptoms. But I also stick to a mostly low residue/small portion eating anyway (from when things were bad). On the other hand, the neuro symptoms kick my ass 😞

Either this IS long covid or it's all related to the inflammation not being treated for so long.

361,Stelara,My doctor said it's time for surgery,"I was diagnosed with morbus crohn in 2017. I had problems accepting it. And I tried to avoid medical treatment as long as I could. I thought I could treat it with natural medicines and a healthy diet. It kept getting worse and I was on the edge. When I came to hospital I was 68 kg with an body height of  1.96 cm.
I went through several different types of medications. I was so scared of side effects. The whole Immunsuppressivum meds freaked me out. But finally I gave up. 
And my weight increased to a healthy amount. I'm kinda regretting to not trust the doctors sooner. I'm pretty thankful nowadays.
But because of the lack of proper treatment I have to deal that my small intestine is pretty scarred. And there's also a stenosis.
Currently I'm on stelara and its working good for me. But I'm in (lot of) pain. I have to take many painkillers. However diarrhea is mostly gone. 
My doctor told me it's best to cut the stenosis out. Its sounds logical to me. So there some questions rising up in my mind.

Longterm: How is your experience with surgery? Were there complications? Did it contribute to your quality of life? 

Short after surgery: How long couldn't you eat? Did you have pain? How about physical activity? How long was the healing?

Btw: I'm pretty sure I have morbus crohn cause I started smoking back when I was 13 years old . And maybe cause of eating lots of sugar and highly processed foods.

Of course, I'm going to urgent care tomorrow morning, but was just looking to hear some people's experiences with things like covid, flu, or even colds.

370,Skyrizi,"OBI Failed, Skyrizi complete has been nothing but a run around","I have been on Skyrizi for a year and a half and I had my first OBI fail on December 1. I got a partial dose. 

Right after it had failed I called Abbvie and spent an hour and a half on the phone repeating the same story to 3 different people. The third person who was the nurse deemed that I was eligible for a replacement but said contact your doctor because we can’t give you medical advice and then call and let us know how much they want to repeat, full or half. I asked if I needed a script. They told me no I just needed to let them know what my doctor wanted to do. Okay, easy enough. 

I got in touch with my doctor who said repeat full dose. I called Abbvie back and told them that - another 30 or so minutes wasted on the phone to be told we need to contact your doctor for a one time script. I’m getting annoyed at this point but okay, fine. I was told as soon as it’s received they’d be in touch to set up delivery. 

It’s now been 5 days. My doctor sent them the one time script on December 2. I haven’t been contacted. I call Abbvie and every dang time it’s like the first time I’m calling even when they’re provided with a case number. I have yet to get in contact with anyone besides product control and the nurse. Ironically, they already had the return packing for the failed OBI sent to my home. 

I’ve spent hours on the phone with no results other than blatant frustration on my end. Is this the typical experience?

371,Skyrizi,Calprotectin levels elevated despite prednisone and Biologic,"Hello everyone, I need some advice. I was just diagnosed  in July and suffered a horrible flare. Since August I have been on prednisone and due to insurance have only had two rounds (every 8 weeks) of Yesintek which is a stelera bio similar. I know this one can take time to become effective. Every time I've tried to taper off the prednisone my symptoms have come back full force. I expected my body to react slightly but days would pass and all of my symptoms would persist and my Gi would tell me to go back up in prednisone. I hate to be on prednisone this long but it's the only thing helping me not go 20 times a day. I will say the symptoms have slightly improved but my calprotectin levels just came back at 800. My GI is wanting to switch me medications to skyrizi. I don't know how to feel. Is it too early to see results from yesintek? Or should I be feeling much better by now? It's hard to tell what's the medication and what's the prednisone because I feel definitely better than where I was at the start of my diagnosis which was pretty bad, but at the same time should I be seeing better results? Is switching medications this early a good option? Has anyone had a similar experience with switching meds and did you notice improvements sooner? It's also definitely disappointing and I just want to feel better. I do feel better but it is most likely the prednisone covering. And lastly should my calp be this high still at this point?

I am past the uncomfortable physical side of the seton, luckily only one,(I have seen some folks on here mention several at once, I am shocked and impressed at your resilience). 

I work offshore on ships to be simply put, gone a month at a time. My time is split between driving the vessel, and then doing manual labor of varying intensity. I am a bit embarrassed, I have to wear depends pretty much anytime, as I am fearful of drainage doing the obvious soak through during my day to day. Is this going to be pretty much my life? My doctor said it varies but I was looking for some more personal experiences. My insurance also denied to cover Skyrizi, so awaiting my doctors appeals to hopefully go through and being the treatment.

388,Skyrizi,Seeking opinions: Have to choose a medication and feeling conflicted due to fibromyalgia and needle phobia,"Hello community, I’ve been diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease (ileocolitis) and my doctor would like me to pick either Skyrizi or Tremfya. 

I’ve done lots of research and am unconcerned about the comparison of side effects and stuff as they are not significant nor are they very different from one another. 

However, I have a crippling and extreme phobia of needles. This is enhanced by the fact that I’ve got fibromyalgia syndrome and so the pain of a needle is much more acute. For example, the iv I had for the procedure was extremely painful for me. This was a week ago and my arm is still extremely sore and hurts to move. I got a blood draw today and havent been able to use the arm all day, it was excruciating. I’ve been looking at the injectors for the two drug options and am paralyzed with indecision. 

On the one hand, skyrizi has the OBI device and I like the idea of not having to manually administer. However, if I understand correctly, the pressing of the button is actually the act of physically pushing the needle into your skin. I also am under the impression that the needle stays in for five whole minutes. This is a huge con as for me I anticipate that’s five minutes of terrible pain. 

On the other hand, tremfya seems to take a shorter time, like 15 seconds instead of five minutes? Correct me if I’m wrong here. But the idea of having to put that much pressure on the needle while it’s inside of me is genuinely terrifying. Getting hugged is quite painful for me, so I can’t imagine the amount of pressure required for the injector device will feel delightful. 

The regular syringe injection is off the table as the phobia is extremely severe and I cannot be exposed to a visible needle. 

Another factor to consider is this:
I am told I need three IV infusions, one hour in length each, over the course of the first 8 weeks prior to starting my at-home subcutaneous injections. With tremfya, there is the option to replace these 3 IV infusion sessions with 14 (or something) smaller injections. This isn’t an option with skyrizi. IV infusions are incredibly painful for me, like writhing and crying type of pain, so I’m wondering if I should pick tremfya just so I can avoid those three sessions altogether. 

Because tremfya hasn’t been approved for crohns for very long I’m just having trouble being able to compare the two. I would love to hear opinions and experiences, anecdotal stuff that I can’t get from reading the academic papers or reading articles.

392,Skyrizi,I thought it was finally working (Skyrizi),"I guess this is more of a vent, but please feel free to share your similar experiences. I started skyrizi around early August and pretty quickly noticed that my stools were more solid and less runny, but not much other improvement until the second infusion. Then, my abdominal pain almost completely went away, and since I started it I've only had one small accident where I didn't make it to the toilet on time. My biggest issue has been urgency and fear of having accidents, and it's gotten so much better. Other symptoms have noticeably improved as well.

Flash forward to now, I did my first at home infusion almost a week ago and I'm feeling right back to how I was before. This started probably the day after the infusion. The urgency is back, the pain is back. I don't understand, it seemed to be working, and the infusion went perfectly with no issues. I know I just need to give it more time but it's so frustrating that I thought I finally had relief and it just vanished so quickly.",2025-11-03 13:19:24,CrohnsDisease,27,1onbjev,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1onbjev/i_thought_it_was_finally_working_skyrizi/,2025-11-03

If I try it will pain me a lot and I will vomit, so resection is inevitable.

So my question is, what is your experience? How big part they usually take? How was the recovery? How your symptoms changed? ",2025-10-31 21:24:06,CrohnsDisease,5,1ol6p5k,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ol6p5k/i_have_stenose_in_terminal_ileum_what_is_your/,2025-10-31
394,Skyrizi,Hyrimoz to Skyrizi,"I was put on Hyrimoz back in April. My symtoms mostly cleared up, so I was shocked that the scope done this month (Oct) still showed inflammation, and my calprotectin is still elevated. 
Additionally, about a month ago, my mild psoriasis, which cleared up completely, developed into wicked pustular psoriasis on my hands and feet. 
This is such a bummer because I have had no side effects except being tired for a day after the shot, and now the monster hands and feet. 

My derm suggests we try Skyrizi next, and the GI is all for it. 

I have been reading such mixed feedback on Skyrizi, as with every med we get offered. I'm nervous. 

I don't know if they will want me to do infusions or home shots. I am worried about being locked into any side effects for longer, too. 

What questions should I ask my doctor next week? Any concerns I should specifically bring up, based on your experiences? Anything you wish you had known before starting it? 

Just trying to be prepared.

396,Skyrizi,New diagnosis - no symptoms,"Hi all,

New diagnosis here, seeking some feedback as I feel my case is different than most I read (which I get one thing about this disease is everyone’s very different)

30’s M, went to the hospital a month ago with a bad stomach ache leading to “gross” puking (to put it mildly) - I had a partial bowel obstruction which subsided in a day with prednisone and an NG tube pump out. 

Inflammation levels were high, and CT scan showed blockage in terminal Illium, so GI docs say probably Crohns. Yesterday colonoscopy confirms no structures, fistulas, abscesses, etc. just TI inflammation, but again per that, they believe Crohns. 

I have felt completely “normal” since the blockage, although on a 12 week taper of prednisone. Doc wants to start skyrizi before the prednisone taper ends. 

My question I guess is, with no other symptoms (regular BM’s, only really dairy / spicy gives me loose stool) no blood, no pain, have never felt a “flare”, non of the Chronic symptoms I read about here or the hell people are in - where does this leave me? Just very early stages?

397,Skyrizi,Feeling Weird,"I’m a young guy (18m) and have had a difficult year so far. I started the year with a terrible abscess, which lasted a couple of miserable weeks until draining on its own. After this in early March I was referred to a CR. CR told me I had a fistula and had to get surgery. This freaked me out so, foolishly, I put it off until the summer. I just wanted to focus on finishing up school. CR sent me for bloodwork and CT scan during my first consult with him to rule out Crohn’s, as I had told him about my weight loss, lack of appetite, etc. CR told me that he would want to avoid a fistulotomy if I had Crohn’s. Blood work showed no real signs of anything, but the CT was a little bit inconclusive. So, I was sent for an MRI, which came back clear, and gave the green light for surgery. Surgery went smoothly, but CR said that he “Saw Signs” of IBD, and was referring me to a GI. GI sent me for a Colonoscopy and Endoscopy, which also went smoothly. He told me that I had Crohn’s, which didn’t seem to be to much of a shock to me as I had some lingering suspicions. I called off going to college for the first semester, and stopped working at the local pub for a couple of months. I started Skyrizi and get my third infusion in a week. Throughout this whole journey, I’ve not struggled very much with cramping, pain, or BMs, and I’ve been able to eat most of my favorite foods. On the contrary I’ve had an apparent lack of hunger for the better part of a year, dizziness/lightheadedness, and a nondescript fuzzy feeling in my mind. I don’t know if it’s a vision change, or something else, but I just feel off. Skyrizi has really helped me so far- I’ve been slowly gaining weight, and been able to walk again, Even picking up a shift or two at the pub. (Although they have been taken slowly or cut short because of lightheadedness/not feeling well.)

What Im wondering is:

•Will this dizziness/fuzziness ever go away?
•Has Skyrizi helped others?
•How can I gain weight, and manage anxiety?
•Should I be hopeful and will I be able to play sports again? 

Sorry for the ramble, my thoughts can sometimes be a little disorganized I tried to think of as many details of the past 10 months as I could. Please be honest! If anyone has any similar experiences or answers lmk. Thanks.

I've been reintroducing some foods (dairy and some fruit) so I'm wondering if that could be it. My partner also tested positive for enteropathogenic E. Coli so I'm going to get tested this week, in case she passed it off. Hopefully it's just this and once resolved I can start to feel better.

399,Skyrizi,Multiple strictures + pouchitis despite biologics — largest stricture causing pain/protrusion for a year. Feeling defeated.,"Hi everyone,

I really need support and perspective from people who understand what it’s like to fight this disease year after year.

**My background:**  
I had a total proctocolectomy with a J-pouch in 2013. After a decade of no real issues, I developed chronic pouchitis and was ultimately diagnosed with Crohn’s affecting the pouch and small intestine. I’ve been through multiple biologics — most recently Skyrizi (which didn’t help after 8+ months), and I’m now on Entyvio. I’ve also had countless CT enterographies and pouchoscopies over the years trying to get this under control.

**My recent MRI enterography findings showed worsening symptoms:**

* Active inflammation through small intestine (ongoing for almost 2 years) and now also the J-pouch (pouchitis)
* *Multiple* strictures (narrowed segments) in the small intestine
* The largest stricture has caused bowel dilation up to 4.4 cm upstream — this fits with the protrusion/swelling and pain I’ve been dealing with for the past year
* Nighttime fecal leakage 4 nights this week alone (there goes my sex life)

The strictures are what really scare me. The largest one has been visibly protruding and causing discomfort for about a year. I've brought this up before, but now the imaging confirms what I’ve been feeling all along — my bowel is narrowing in multiple places, and things are backing up.

**Emotionally, I’m burned out.** I feel like I’m doing everything right — surgery, biologics, diet, health routines — and my disease keeps progressing anyway. I’m scared Entyvio isn’t working, and I don’t know what’s next.

**I’d love to hear from anyone who can share:**

* Have you had multiple strictures and pouch involvement, and found a treatment that actually helped?
* If you were in this situation after Skyrizi and/or Entyvio failed, what biologic or therapy helped you next (anti-TNF, Rinvoq, combo therapy, dilation, etc.)?
* Were your strictures inflammatory (responded to meds) or fibrotic (needed dilation or surgery)?
* And honestly… how do you cope mentally when it feels like your body keeps losing ground no matter what you do?

Thank you to anyone willing to share advice, experience, or encouragement. I know everyone’s disease is different, but it helps so much just hearing from people who’ve been where I am and made it through.",2025-10-18 19:32:48,CrohnsDisease,8,1oa504b,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oa504b/multiple_strictures_pouchitis_despite_biologics/,2025-10-18
400,Skyrizi,Two immunosuppressants at the same time?,"Hey fam, I (21F) have had Crohn’s since I was 8 and have been on remicade infusions since I was 10, my miracle drug.

Rinvoq daily pill no more infusions.

Skyrizi injection along with remicade infusions.

6mp daily pill with infusions (not a fan of this one too scared of the side effects)

I can’t eat anything. I’ve lost 60 pounds. Enough complaining, the struggle has been real, as I’m sure you all know the feeling. 

TODAY IS A GOOD DAY. I got the diagnosis finally this morning. She wasn’t gonna prescribe me steroids originally because she wanted to try a prescription powder (cholestyramine) to bind my diarrhea. I left and had a teeth cleaning afterwards so she called me and I missed it. I checked to see if my original powder prescription was ready and I saw the rx for the steroids. I cried 😭😭😭😭 I am SO HAPPY. They will have it in stock at 3:30 and imma take that ish immediately and tomorrow I should already be feeling better. I’m so happy to finally have answers and be getting relief. Words are immeasurable to the amount of joy I am feeling.

406,Skyrizi,Now it's my turn to ask...,"I usually hang out here to give support and relate my experiences to others. But now things have changed a bit for me and I'm curious about others' experiences. Yeah, it's a minor thing, but underneath the hood there might be more going on.

I've been off methotrexate for about 3 months now as I go through the infusion doses of Skyrizi. What's changed is that instead of normal poops at night (in fact, just-before-bed poops are new), I occasionally have a lumpy, liquidy movements. No burning prior as if I forgot to take my Questran to absorb the bile salts, just an urge to go. And not a lot of volume, either. However, it's a change. Same diet during during the day - cereal with lactose-free milk in the morning with an espresso chaser. Been doing the daily espresso twice a day for about 8 years now with no side-effects. Followed by a normal lunch of pb&amp;j or a BLT sub. Meals at night include pasta or chicken. My wife made lasagna a few nights ago, and although I'm lactose intolerant to whole milk, ricotta and mozzerella seem fine.  If I was lactose intolerant to the cheeses, I would have had problems after eating. Not so, though. Some nights, all is normal.

So, I'm thinking that stopping the methotrexate has caused the change. And it's too soon for the Skyrizi to actually start working. I changed to Skyrizi because a recent colonoscopy showed some increased inflammation at the ileum (or where it used to be -- had a resection back in 1980). And for those who have read some of my posts, I've had CD since 1980 with remission for 20 years. CD came back and for 25 years have had mild symptoms. I hate to think that now, at age 70, that the disease is ramping up to make my last 20 years miserable.

I've always read about flares, but experience in this first hand was very concerning to her and to me. Luckily, the CT scan showed no blockages or other severe damage. It was just severe inflammation, which also showed on her stool tests. She's improving now she's a college student in his back on campus.

416,Skyrizi,No sleep/chronic fatigue,My boyfriend has crohns and I have been learning about this god awful disease through him. Along with the bowel symptoms he has had a terrible time trying to get enough rest. We sleep separately as we are long distance so I at least know I am not disturbing him in his sleep. No matter what he gets no more than 3-4.5 hours a night. I can see the toll this is taking on his mental acuity and more importantly his mental health. It is crushing to watch. He is on a biologic (skyrizi) and is taking peptides (like BPC-157) and has been prescribed trazodone for sleep (which he has found unhelpful). He also is religious about his sleep schedule and goes to bed at the same time every night and follows a whole routine. Nothing is helping. It is such a vicious cycle because if you cannot rest you cannot recover. Has anyone had experience with this? Have they been able to re-regulate their sleep schedule?

417,Skyrizi,Scared to take five day course of Levaquin,"I was just coincidentally diagnosed with Yersinia. I had my 12 weeks check in before my third Skyrizi infusion. They did a stool panel on Thursday.

Friday I got woken up by having to go. I had loose stools twice. I thought it was the miso soup I had the night before so I took an Imodium. It worked pretty well. I had a few tender twinges of abdominal pain throughout the day, but again chalked it up to upset food tummy. I had one more semi solid stool that night after eating. I had messaged my doctor about it asking if there’s a way to differentiate between a food-based upset tummy vs a Crohn’s / Skyrizi upset.

Late Friday night the stool panel came in. Positive for Yersinia. 

Called the doctor’s line because I didn’t know what to do because I had to fly today, and I didn’t know if once I left the state I could be treated if it was needed, or if I could let this pass on its own. I actually haven’t pooped at all today, but I have had twinges of pain that last for a second or two and then go away. The first gastro said he would lean towards not giving me antibiotics and see if I could pass it on my own. The first gastro got ahold of my IBD doctor and apparently they discussed it and decided out of caution, my doctor wants to treat it since I JUST got my infusion.

They want to put me on five days of Levaquin. I’m honestly scared out of my mind. I already deal with autoimmune induced small nerve fibers neuropathy and muscle / joint issues. I’m terrified of the long term side effects that can happen. I’m terrified of getting C. Diff. I’m scared of permanently fucking up my gut flora I’ve been working so hard this year to try and repair. I’m scared I’m going to take this and my gut will be permanently messed up. I mentioned to the doctor I’ll do what I need to do, but I’m scared to mess up my gut flora I’ve worked all year to really try and fix and heal as much as I could. He said to me by me getting this, the flora is already messed up, so essentially that ship has sailed. I asked how long after the antibiotics would it take for me to repair it to what it was. He basically said that if I could, it would take awhile, but I may not be able to. He did say the chances of C Diff on Levaquin is less than Cipro, which is why they suggested Levaquin instead.

It was really anxiety producing and demoralizing. I’m used to it with this disease but just hearing it caused me to cry in defeat. Maybe I’m being stupid, but I kept wondering to myself do I hang onto the antibiotics and see if my body can pass this on its own since Skyrizi isn’t as intense of a med. If the symptoms get worse than start taking them. My brain and common sense is telling me I should take the meds and bite the bullet.

Looking for those of you that have taken Levaquin. Did it permanently mess up your gut? Did you get or not get C diff? Or was it fine because it wasn’t like Cipro? Looking for everyone’s experiences and hoping they are more positive.

418,Skyrizi,Hives/Rash,"Finally I was able to get into a “remission” like state after getting on Skyrizi. However, just recently I started getting rashes everywhere on my body. Always red, sometimes bumpy, sometimes splotchy, etc. 

I have been taking on quite a bit of work recently. We had another engineer fired, and I basically got given all his issues to solve. On top of that I got put in charge of 3 different initiative groups for corporate all at once. So I’m thinking it may be related to stress. 

So I was wondering if anyone is having similar experiences as I know people with Crohn’s or UC are more prone to stress rash. Does anyone have recommendations? I’ve tried Benadryl, Hydrocortisone Cream, Zyrtec, Prednisone, and a Steroid injection with no real help…

419,Skyrizi,For those of you in remission: do you drink alcohol at all?,"Not to jinx it, but after six months of Skyrizi + mesalamine I feel like I'm in a pretty good place—if not bona fide remission, then just about. I still err on the safe side about what I eat, although I'm slowly pushing those boundaries to see what I can tolerate again, but one thing I haven't tried is alcohol. (Which I haven't really missed, since before my diagnosis I drank very little and very rarely, but now I keep getting offered beer at dinners with my coworkers and that doesn't seem like the ideal time to start experimenting with what I can stomach :P)

If you're in remission, do you drink at all? Have you noticed that certain types of alcohol agree with you more than others?",2025-09-18 16:03:13,CrohnsDisease,28,1nkcbut,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nkcbut/for_those_of_you_in_remission_do_you_drink/,2025-09-18
420,Skyrizi,Can’t eat solids without having pain due to intestinal spasming,"Been on Skyrizi for a month shy of a year. My doctor was happy with my colonoscopy in May which showed a lot of improvement and my disease is considered mild. I do have some mild narrowing in the terminal ileum but my doctor says it’s very small and nothing to worry about. I have had 3 partial blockages before. 

During the summer months I started having constipation and more frequent pain, I had an mri about a month ago which showed pretty much the same thing as my colonoscopy plus a small ovarian cyst. It also showed I had a moderate amount of stool in my colon (constipation). I do go every day but it’s typically not a lot. 

Recently in the last almost 2 weeks after every bowel movement I have some serious pain afterwards. It’s progressed to where it’s now after I eat anything solid so I’ve been on a mostly liquid diet. The pain feels like I’m having spasms in my intestines. I started taking dicyclomine which has helped a lot but doesn’t get rid of the pain completely. My doctor is now prescribing linvess to try and get things moving. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? Why do my intestines have painful spasms for hours until I take dicyclomine? I don’t know how it could just be constipation that’s causing this much pain.

Mine is awful. All I want to do is sleep. A good night’s sleep doesn’t help and neither do naps. I’m taking them throughout the day. Coffee doesn’t help at all.

My GI doctor doesn’t believe it’s Crohn’s because otherwise I have no symptoms. Scope was good albeit microscopic inflammation. I’m on Skyrizi too.

Bloodwork is good too. 

So wanted to know if this is typical of Crohn’s and whether I should get a second opinion. If you know anything that has helped, please share too :)

I stopped methotrexate two months ago in preparation to transitioning to Skyrizi. I've had two loading doses so far, but...

It seems that if there's any stress, I have lumpy, liquid stools in the evening, never during the day. I have always had normal poops once or twice a day for decades. And the lumpy/loose/liquidy poop goes away after a day or so. This is new and I'm wondering if the change in medication has made a change in me as well. I'm not really concerned yet, but I have to keep an eye on it and try to evaluate what triggers it. The two times I had it, I was stressed a little about getting out of the house on time for a road trip. We were running late and I, partly because of (suspected) Autism, got stressed. Later that day (both times) I had poop issues that went away after the stress was removed.

425,Skyrizi,What treatment efficient with fistulas ?,"Hello,

I am a 32M and have been diagnosed with Crohn in 2017. My symptoms were intense pain, weight loss, digestive issues, etc since the ulcerations were mainly seen at the ileum. At that time, I started a treatment with Remicade that worked pretty well but they switched my treatment after two years for Entyvio since I had anormal liver enzymes measures (nothing else). I had Entyvio for two years too and then I moved abroad and stopped taking a treatment because I was feeling pretty well and in remission aside from some digestive inconveniences from time to time, so tried to see how it would go without.

Fast forward to 2025 - I just got diagnosed with some anal fistulas that are being analysed by a CRS and I have an appointment with a GI later in October. I will probably need to do exams (colonoscopy etc) to see where I stand (I don’t have many other symptoms aside from the fact that I lost a little bit of weight and feel I have more BMs than before) but I know I’ll probably get under treatment again since my Crohn seems to be quite active again. 

What’s your experience with the newest treatments (Skyrizi, etc) when it comes to these kind of perineal issues (anal fistula) that are new to me ? I kind of read that the best was Remicade (which I was tolerating okay for some years) but I don’t know if that’s because we lack more reviews since these new treatments haven’t been fully evaluated yet for this. 

Thanks a lot in advance !",2025-09-05 21:30:28,CrohnsDisease,2,1n9hnfm,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n9hnfm/what_treatment_efficient_with_fistulas/,2025-09-05
427,Skyrizi,Skyrizi and throat tightness/hoarse voice,"I was curious to know if any of you that are on Skyrizi are having a pretty constant feeling of tightness in your throat and a voice that becomes hoarse more easily.

  
I have been on Skyrizi for about 6 months and am experiencing vocal shakiness, weakness, throat muscle tightness, and a hoarseness that comes and goes with no rhyme or reason.

I have no known allergies, no proof of reflux (but treated myself for silent reflux anyway and it did not seem to help my issues), and no other new medical conditions. The only thing that has changed in my life is the use of Skyrizi.

I traced these symptoms back to a few months ago, which just so happened to be the time I started Skyrizi.   I am beginning to think this drug may be the culprit.  I was on Rinvoq for 5 months and lose my voice almost the entire time.  I know Rinvoq is a different type of inhibitor, but I'm wondering if there is a correlation somehow.   

  
I am very curious if any of you have had this as a side effect?  There are so many side effects not listed when it comes to these medications, depression and anxiety being one of them when it came to being on Rinvoq (if you're interested in this, feel free to check out my post history).  Turns out tons of other people experienced the side effects I mentioned, which lead me to coming off of it, which fixed the problem right away, and which is making me question Skyrizi now even more.

I am not on any other medications. 

  
Would love to hear your experiences if this sounds like something you've encountered.  Thank you in advance for your replies!

428,Skyrizi,"Skyrizi, birth control, and menstruation - has anyone had any weird hormonal side effects or period-related flares?","I've used Nexplanon birth control implants for the last 9 years, and it's been great - with all 3 implants, my period stopped for the first 2 years, then I'd get really light periods on a regular schedule for the last year. I was diagnosed with Crohn's while my 2nd Nexplanon was in, and it didn't seem to change my cycles. However, I started Skyrizi earlier this year, and now everything is out of whack!! My period came back 6 months later than usual, and it also sent me into a 3-week ""mini flare"". Now that my period is gone, my flare is also gone...

Up to now, the only Skyrizi side effect I noticed was acne/congested skin, so I'm curious if there are other folks with funky hormonal stuff! So, has anyone else noticed any weird hormonal side effects from Skyrizi? Or, has anyone on Nexplanon noticed a difference pre- vs. post-Crohn's diagnosis? 

P.S. I already spoke to my gastroenterologist, and she said there were no hormonal side effects mentioned in the Skyrizi literature, but it's not unusual to uncover more side effects within the first few years of approval/widespread use.

First, strongly recommend signing up for the skyrizi program that covers your copay (saves $$$) and hooks you up with a nurse ambassador. My very nice nurse ambassador facetimed me while I did this and it really helped ease my nerves because my fears were more so about messing it up than needles. 

It went very smoothly! I had it out of the fridge a little over an hour ahead of time. I had watched the training video a few times in preparation but the included instructions were very good as well. Putting it together all went fine and the injection itself was only a tiny prick and not really uncomfortable, although it disperses the meds over several minutes. 

It's a few hours later now and I definitely feel unusually tired. That was also the case after my loading dose infusions but not when I was on Infliximab. 

All in all, I didn't need to be so nervous. I feel confident I can do it on my own without my nurse ambassador next time. ",2025-08-13 22:33:29,CrohnsDisease,5,1mpiw1z,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mpiw1z/first_self_injection_report_skyrizi_obi/,2025-08-13
435,Skyrizi,"Rinvoq Update - switching again, this time to Skyrizi","I posted back in January about my 23 years on Remicade and how it wasn’t working to control inflammation any longer and was about to switch to Rinvoq. Figured I’d update my situation in case it helps anyone or if anyone had any insights for me. 

Original post is linked for reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/s/9fMKJKqNyw

I started Rinvoq back in January at an induction dose of 45mg. It worked quick, within a couple of days, and suddenly I was feeling what “good” was actually supposed to feel like. Went really well for a couple of weeks and then downhill from there. The Jakne started first and was so bad I had to see a derm. Clindamycin was prescribed but I can’t say it controlled it much. It was super irritating to show up to work with acne. I did the induction dose for 3 months and dropped to the 30 mg maintenance dose.  Immediately flared with bleeding which prompted me to do a short course of pred while figuring things out with my doctor. Doc put me back on 45mg to see if it would control things but said it could only be for a month. Apparently 30mis the highest possible maintenance dose. 

In the meantime, I developed bad eczema on my face and the derm prescribed Vtama and then pimecrolimus to control. I was so frustrated and didn’t see a good outcome when I did have to drop back to 30mg, I insisted to my doc that I needed to switch drugs again. We agreed to Skyrizi as it was working really well for my mother and he started the insurance process to get the drug approved. I was expecting to stay on Rinvoq 45 until all of that was done and the first Skyrizi infusion was scheduled. 

The Gi doc asked that I complete the usual labs that day and the results were not good. Signs of anemia (new for me) fecal calprotectin of 1200 and liver enzymes over 100. He said he couldn’t let me continue on the Rinvoq given the liver enzymes and to stop immediately.  I went an all of 4 or 5 days before starting to experience symptoms and started pred again, this time for 20 days thinking that would tide me over until the first infusion. 


First Skyrizi went smoothly but I received feedback from the nurses and my mother that it takes a long time to work and that I probably wouldn’t feel better until the second infusion. At the same time, everyone my doc has put on it has stayed on it. So, here I am, 2 weeks away from the 2nd infusion, off the pred, with an annoyed colon and eczema flaring again almost as soon as the pred ended.

I don’t know where this eczema came from. I’ve never had anything like this before and it seems to flare anytime the Crohns flares. I don’t know if the Remicade was controlling it all these years or if this is some immune thing that the Rinvoq triggered that I’m now stuck with. It’s the cherry on top of everything for me sure. 

Anyway, hope my experience is helpful to others. Would appreciate any insights y’all have as well.

It seems Skyrizi has maybe taken a turn from ""not suitable for perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease"" in the research studies from 5 years ago, to being a treatment option recently? All the old literature saying No is making me nervous and there is so little literature about why it's now being recommended, probably because it's a relatively recent change. Anyone have any insights or experiences of their own?

I've had Crohn's with perianal fistulas since 2006. The fistulas have calmed down but I've yet to get into remission - there's always just some inflammation left. I've been on Remicade and azathioprine which has been Pretty Good, but my new GI team wants to try Skyrizi to see if we can get there all the way to remission.

I've been on Remicade for so long, and for so long it was the only option for perianal Crohn's, and with the risk of going off meaning you can't go back on again in the future (antibody response), I am so scared I honestly want to vomit at the idea of changing.

But I KNOW that SOMETHING needs to change to address this inflammation, I have to think long term. And dare I hope that maybe the risk is worth it if it means living a life unchained to bathroom range??

I’ve jumped through every hoop to try and get a replacement but now the pharmacy is saying they cannot find me on file. It’s been about six weeks now since I missed the last dose and around 14 weeks since my last successful injection. I’m not currently experiencing any major gastrointestinal symptoms other than constant mild nausea and loose stools, but I am experiencing extreme fatigue (I sleep around 16 hours a day when I am able). I’m already missing most of my large intestine and I don’t want this to be the reason I lose the rest. I’m worried that having missed a dose I have started to develop an immunity to the medication. I’m running out of biologics to try and this was kind of a last chance. Has anyone been in the same boat and did things seem to work out for you?

Edit:
I already contacted AbbVie multiple times over this and we went through the process of getting a new one approved. I got all the way through and then they said that my pharmacy couldn’t find me on file, or they were waiting on a script from my doctor (which was sent within days of the injections failure).

ATP I’m less worried about getting a replacement as it’s basically time for my next dose anyways. I am just wondering if anyone who has had a similar experience has had an issue with developing immunity against the drug as that is what I am most concerned about.

445,Skyrizi,"My recent Crohn’s hospitalization — finding answers, facing fears, and starting a new chapter","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share what I’ve been going through recently with my Crohn’s — both for anyone who might relate and also just to process it all.

Over the past couple of weeks, I started having severe abdominal pain and cramping that kept getting worse. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t keep anything down, and I honestly started to get scared. I ended up in the ER, and after some tests, I was admitted to the hospital.

A CT scan showed thickening in my intestinal walls and what looked like a developing blockage — thankfully not from scar tissue, but due to inflammation. I have Crohn’s in the ileum (the part that connects the small and large intestines), and they described the sensation as “two pieces of sandpaper rubbing together” whenever food or stool passed through. That really hit me.

I was put on IV steroids (methylprednisolone) and fluids immediately and started a full liquid diet — just jello, broth, water, and juice. I had a colonoscopy a few days in, which confirmed significant inflammation, but again — no surgery needed. I’ve also had an iron infusion while here since I’ve been dealing with anemia.

The steroids are doing their job. My inflammatory markers have been steadily dropping, and I was told today that they’re now at a 4 — within normal range. I’ve been scared to even move too much, in case I somehow “mess it up,” but I’m trying to trust the process and my care team.

Soon, I’ll be transitioning from IV to oral steroids and starting on a biologic. Right now, it’s between Skyrizi and Entyvio. I’m still learning about both and hoping to choose what’s right for my case and lifestyle. My doctor has been supportive, and I really value his guidance.

I’ve also been juggling a lot of fear around work and finances during this time. I’m hourly, and I don’t have short-term disability benefits. But my manager actually covered my missed shifts this week — something I didn’t expect, and something I’m so deeply grateful for. That kind of support has meant the world to me.

This experience has been intense, emotionally and physically. I’ve cried a lot, felt powerless at times, and wondered what life will look like after this. But I’m also feeling hopeful for the first time in a while. I’m focusing on getting through one day at a time and learning how to take better care of myself moving forward.

If anyone here has been on Skyrizi or Entyvio and wants to share their experience — or just wants to say hi — I’d really appreciate it. I’m sending love and strength to anyone going through a flare or stuck in the middle of figuring this disease out. You’re not alone.

446,Skyrizi,Post Resection Concerns :(,"Hey everyone. After failing entyvio and spending 9 months in the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, my GI decided it was time to have a resection. I went to the ER on may 3rd in probably the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. Leading up to this, I was in a ton of pain but this day when I woke up at 4am, it was actually a 12/10 in pain. I had my resection scheduled in two weeks but I knew this felt different and needed to go to the ER. Turns out I had formed multiple abscesses and some ever ruptured. I stayed in the hospital for 8 days and then went home with drains and a PICC line for IV nutrition. I managed pain with prescribed meds for 10 days until my surgery. The surgery went well and I am now 7 weeks post op as I write this. I was doing AMAZING up until a few days ago. I started developing some minor pain in the same area as before(lower right abdomen). Obviously this pain is NOTHING close to the pain I was In before. Im currently on flagyl with the plan being to start skyrizi when the insurance is all figured out in around 2-3 weeks. I of course messaged my GI a few hours ago with this concern. I just wanted to come here and see if anyone else has experienced this. I truly hope that this isn't the start of more inflammation already because I genuinely can not fathom going through anything like that again.

450,Skyrizi,Concerned about Leave of Absence &amp; Abscess,"Hello reddit,

Going through rough times ever since I was officially diagnosed with CD last year June. I've been off work for several months last year due to a very severe flare that landed me in the ER and have been on Skyrizi for 1 year now.

I've also switched jobs within the same company for better pay and now it's putting a huge toll on my health mentally and physically. I've only been in this new, current role for 4 months now but I've been constantly targeted and berated by the Team Lead for not stepping up my game. I've also being gaslit and lied by the Team Lead that they've ""shown it before and provided extensive training"" when the training on most parts were done on a bare minimum out of reluctance and I had to pick up all the pieces by myself. And apparently I'm also not allowed to ask people in the team or anyone else for help because apparently that is inefficient and wasting people's time and resources. I never had a team like this before and have been 2 other teams in the same company but this team was really an eye-opener to me in terms of all the gaslighting, lies, and drama going on especially being targeted towards me since I'm still new. 

I've been working overtime , \~10 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while getting unpaid for all of those OT hours and was told to suck it up even though it should only be a 8 hour shift per day but discovered that I have a perianal abscess growing on my right side which made me panic since last week Wednesday. I couldn't take time off and see the doctor earlier since they kept complaining that I've been away from work a lot more compared to others in the team and had to wait until yesterday over the weekend. 

GP seemed pretty concerned on the size of the abscess and gave me a large dose of Cipro while channeling to my GI doc on the on-going abscess. I'm pretty stunned right now too since I haven't had abscess since 7 years ago and deeply worried it might pop and burst into another fistula which I also had a very complex surgery before to repair the anal fistulas. I've been having panic attacks every morning trying to meet all the tight deadlines while being berated and abused by my Team Lead every single day and could feel my heart rate rushing every morning by logging into at 7:30 AM and getting the deliverables all out on time. 

Now I feel body aches, headaches, and pain after taking Cipro and my body feels so stiff while I'm currently experiencing a fever. I really rather not let this turn into a fistula and was debating to take another medical leave of absence to recover physically and mentally. I've been so nervous about the current situation because I've had a really bad abscess before and it exploded into a complex fistula while my current team has a very toxic working environment which I now deeply regret joining just for the small pay bump and at least in my old team, they never complained or gave me a hard time for taking time off work for medical reasons. In this team, even my manager lashed out at me for taking 3 days off in a single month when I was visiting the GI doctor and hospital for MRI scans and bloodwork when they already knew about how I had ""medical related health issues"" before I was hired for his team. 

I don't have much motivation left to even work with this current team anymore since I'm going through a CD related flare and abscess while the Team Lead is trying to actively get rid of me in this toxic team. My Calprotectin numbers are still relatively high, &gt;300 and seeing symptoms appearing here and there and the high amount of stress and work pressure is making it worse for me overall that I can't really focus on my work anymore.

I thought about taking paid medical leave to take care of my health and recover quicker by getting into remission faster rather than waste more of my time dealing with this team and also find a different job in the meantime since this isn't really working out with me. Does anyone have experience taking medical leave 6 months+ due to CD to get it fully under control and into remission before going back to work? I would appreciate it if anyone can provide their experiences with medical leave and how they also dealt with this kind of similar situation.

452,Skyrizi,Rinvoq Trigger Bleeding?,"Would you please share your experience if you had significant GI bleeding while on Rinvoq?

* Was the bleeding a new symptom for you?
* How long where you on Rinvoq and what dosage when bleeding started?
* Can you comment on any complications you might have had when the bleeding started (e.g. strictures, fistulas, active flare, obstruction, any infections including the common cold, etc.)?
* Any other combination medications while on Rinvoq?

I had severe bleeding, a new symptom for me, on my tenth day on 45mg Rinvoq.  I have had strictures for more than 10 years.  Rinvoq's impact on my active flare at the time seemed mixed... an ultrasound 3 days earlier showed significant improvement, but the day prior to the ultrasound I had zero appetite.  When the bleeding started, I had landed in Santa Fe just a few hours earlier (7,000 feet elevation; I am sensitive to elevation and feel it in my GI, even prior to Rinvoq).  I was on combination therapy at the time... Skyrizi for about 3 months.

\[I discontinued Rinvoq, bleeding stopped, but other flare symptoms started again.  I am now on budesonide (and Skyrizi).  My MD is recommending that I try 45mg Rinvoq again after the induction with budesonide takes hold.  The published trials site a total of 4 patients that experienced GI perforations while on Rinvoq.  On review, the perforations occurred when the patients had active Crohn’s disease, either with flare, deep ulcers in the areas of perforation or with complications (stricture, obstruction, or fistula).\]

456,Skyrizi,"Managing decompressed/narrowed bowel segment near J-pouch; surgeon delaying surgery, looking for advice or shared experience","This is also posted in r/IBD:

Hi all. I’m more than 10+ years post-colectomy with a J-pouch, originally for presumed ulcerative colitis. In early 2025, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s (or Crohn’s-like inflammation, depending on progress note) after biopsy findings showed ulceration and granulomas in the afferent limb.

A CT scan in December 2024 showed a 7cm decompressed/narrowed segment near the pouch, with some upstream dilation. A follow-up CT in June 2025 showed a second narrowed segment about 5cm further up. These areas have never been visible on pouchoscopy, but correlate with worsening symptoms: a firm bulge above my navel after eating, distention, discomfort, and loud gurgling sounds when food finally passes.

I had been on Skyrizi for 8+ months with no improvement, so my GI switched me to Entyvio in May 2025 to better target gut-specific inflammation. I’m also on a temporary budesonide taper while Entyvio ramps up.

The surgeon is hesitant to operate now due to the risk of making things worse, including pouch damage, and wants to wait three months to reassess with a scope and decide next steps. But again, they've never been seen via pouchoscopy so this feels like a blow-off.

Has anyone else experienced:

* Did anyone experience **strictures or functional narrowing not seen on pouchoscopy**, only on CT/MRE?
* If so, what kind of imaging or surgical approach helped?
* A successful treatment or approach that helped avoid pouch loss?
* Any colorectal surgeons or IBD specialists in the Pacific Northwest (excluding UW, as they're not in network for me) you’d recommend for a second opinion?

I'm with Virginia Mason right now and feel like I'm stuck in their system and getting mediocre care and follow up. Thanks in advance for any shared experience or advice.

457,Skyrizi,Skyrizi pals - looking for your help/experience!,"Recently switched from Rinvoq to Skyrizi. For history, previously failed Entyvio and Inflectra. Rinvoq worked well for me, my fcal stayed below 50 for a year. I switched due to the side effects - joint pain, carpal tunnel, periods stopped, weight gain.
Whilst on the loading doses, I had a few wobbles, fcal increased above “normal” but not to considered IBD levels. I had loose movements for a few weeks and some pain but was generally manageable. 
In the last two weeks before my first OBI dose things seemed great. Solid 💩s all round, pain subsided. I did my first OBI dose a week ago and I’d say for the past week at least, things have been getting worse. Last night I was up in the middle of the night with cramping and having multiple loose stools a day. I have an appointment with my GI next week and am sure she’ll get another fcal done, but I’m curious if anyone else with Crohn’s has had this kind of drop off after reducing dose?

460,Skyrizi,Anemia and CRP levels,"Hello everyone! I’m writing this because I can’t figure out some stuff about my blood work.
First point: anemia. I did my blood work a month ago, and my hemoglobin was 9.9 with low iron while my ferritin was in normal range. I took some iron supplements as my GI suggested and one month later I had another test, and my hemoglobin got to 9.8! I wasn’t expecting much but I didn’t think it would go down, even if by a little bit! Ferritin is still in normal range, but it seems that the iron supplement did nothing. Did anyone else experience something similar? My GI actually mentioned the idea of having a different kind of anemia (like Mediterranean) and I really really hope not… it made me pretty anxious honestly. 
Anyways, my second question is in regards of CPR. I am now 7 months into Skyrizi treatment, after the first 3 infusions I felt great, had pretty much normal bowel movements and generally great quality of life! Ever since I started with the injections I noticed I wasn’t feeling as good as I used to. I started going more times to the bathroom and feeling worse - not as bad as I did when I wasn’t following a treatment, but not as good as with the infusions.
This brings me to the main topic: my CRP levels are still abnormally high, though they have been in decline since I started my therapy. To give you an idea, when I started the treatment they were around 92 mg/L and now are 54 mg/L (normal should be like 0-7 mg/L). They definitely went down, but are still very high. Could this be a sign that the biologic isn’t working well? My GI was also a bit perplexed by how high these levels still were…
I am a bit frightened, I’m 22 and have a lot of stuff to do with university exams and I’m so scared to fail biologics and having to start all over again. The anemia really isn’t helping too, tbh..
Sorry if this has become a bit of a rant but I’m just so stressed by this situation, it’s so unfair.

464,Skyrizi,Skyrizi/ low immune system,"I have Crohn's and have taken all 3 starter doses of Skyrizi.

Aftery first dose (weeks after) I had massive lumps on my neck and they were extremely sore. Within 24 hours I had signs of a UTI, 12 hours after that I started fevers for three days of 103. After I couldn't get my fever down I went to the ER with severe body aches, nausea, vomiting and fever. Diagnosed with what they said looks like the start of a kidney infection. 

After my third dose very similar situation. Started with massive lumps and pain in my neck. 48 hours later a UTI. 12 hours later ended up in hospital for severe body pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. They said it looked like the start of pneumonia and I was probably getting a virus. 48 hours later I started getting a cold (had that for 22 days) and that turned into an ear infection. 

I know I am more suspectable to infection but I am concerned about my neck/esophagus. I had a CT of my chest and it looked fine and I also had an ultrasound of my thyroid and that was fine as well. 

It's been weeks since all of this has happened and my neck is extremely sore, my throat hurts a little bit but it's mainly my neck.

470,Skyrizi,The war on drugs could kill chronic illness patients,"I have Crohn’s disease, and while it’s technically in remission right now, I still experience scary and painful complications—like massive GI bleeds and bowel impactions. On two separate ER visits, I was taken in, had labs drawn, and then put back into the waiting room while critical results were overlooked. It wasn’t until hours later that they noticed something was seriously wrong. It’s clear that being labeled as a chronic illness patient who frequently visits the ER led to my care being deprioritized. That stigma is real and can be life-threatening.

My pain has never been truly managed by opiate pain medications or other standard pain management methods. It’s frustrating because I end up feeling like a “defective junkie” every time I go to the hospital, constantly asking for more relief—not because I’m chasing a high, but because my body is in unbearable pain. The pain isn’t just limited to flare-ups; it can come from complications, immune reactions, or just my body being in a constant state of inflammation. The standard ER routine is Zofran, pain meds, and fluids. It’s like a checklist, and when I need more relief, I’m often treated like a drug seeker.

Recently, I made a post about how benzodiazepines and antihistamines have completely changed my Crohn’s management and my overall well-being. I don’t have mental health issues (other than ADHD and some PTSD that was healed and addressed by EMDR about 10 years ago). I’ve done neuropsych evaluations over and over to prove that I’m neurologically sound—because, as many women know, doctors often assume that physical symptoms are purely emotional.

In real life, I’m just a normal 23 year old person. I went to a typical college, joined a sorority, loved to party, and yes, enjoyed a party favor here and there. Now, I’m basically a homebody. I don’t even drink anymore for the sake of my health, and I love the gym, hot yoga, and Pilates. Yet, the second I walk into an ER, I feel a deep sense of shame—like I know that whoever walks in the room might see me as just another “frequent flyer” looking for drugs.

One recent ER visit really highlighted this. I was having a severe immune reaction to my Skyrizi infusion—fever, hot skin, overall body pain, and a bunch of disgusting symptoms I'll spare you from hearing about. They wanted to follow the same pain management routine, but I finally spoke up. I was like, “Stop. I’m in a very specific kind of pain, and I know this isn’t going to help. We need to try something else.” A compassionate ER doctor decided to give me IV Ativan as a shot in the dark to calm my nervous system. It worked—better than anything else had.

After that, I talked to my psychiatrist (I only see her for my Adderall prescription) about the experience, and we had a long conversation about how benzodiazepines have gotten a bad rap. There’s this narrative that benzos are inherently evil or just for anxiety, but that’s not the whole story. My psychiatrist decided to prescribe me Klonopin (after trying Xanax, which didn’t work well for me). It’s been life-changing. I can take it up to twice a day when needed, and it genuinely helps with my pain without making me feel too out of it compared to opiates which have served nothing for me.

The biggest relief of all? I no longer feel terrified of getting sick at home. I live alone, and up until now, I’d have to rush to the ER anytime I felt faint or close to passing out—just for my own safety. That constant fear was exhausting, but now I have a way to manage it. I’m about to move in with my boyfriend in a week and a half, and I already know this will minimize ER visits just by having someone there to support me. I feel like I finally have a practical toolbox for managing my symptoms, and it’s made me feel safer and more in control of my life.

But here’s the kicker: the ER doctor who helped me that night put in my file that I came in for a “panic attack” because that was the easiest way to explain why he gave me Ativan. It’s not that he didn’t know I was having an allergic reaction—he definitely knew. But writing out all the nuanced details about my reaction, why Ativan was needed, and how it helped would have been a long, painstaking process. I honestly can’t blame him. It’s the reality of an overwhelmed healthcare system where doctors are stretched so thin that they don’t have the time or bandwidth to thoroughly document every complicated case.

The problem is that this shortcut—writing “panic attack” in my file—has dangerous consequences. The next time I go to the ER, another doctor might look at that note and see it as evidence that I’m just an anxious woman looking for benzos. And that scares me to death. I’m genuinely afraid that I could walk into an ER with a life-threatening complication and be left untreated because of this label. This is how people die in ER waiting rooms—because the system has made it easier to dismiss patients than to truly evaluate them. It’s not just me who suffers. Everyone involved in this broken system is affected—the doctors, the patients, everyone.

This is bigger than just me. The U.S. healthcare system is failing patients like me because doctors are overworked and undereducated on how to treat chronic illness patients who don’t fit the usual mold. They don’t have the time or mental bandwidth to think creatively or holistically about care, so they fall back on outdated, stigmatizing practices. The stigma around medications labeled as “dangerous” needs to change. We need to look at individual cases with nuance and stop gatekeeping treatments that could change lives.

We need to have a conversation about this stigma and the lack of nuance when it comes to medications like benzos. The war on drugs has created such a fear around anything potentially addictive that doctors are afraid to use meds that could genuinely help when used responsibly. I’m just tired of it, and I know I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

I’d love to hear from others who have dealt with similar situations. How do you advocate for yourself when you feel like your pain management needs are dismissed?

(I'm getting some criticism in the replies so I just want to emphasize that antihistamine medications have been just as big of a player in this treatment plan of mine along with the Klonipin. It's significantly less controversial and doesn't really pertain to the subject at hand so I didn't elaborate on it much. Please know that this treatment plan I am on is multifaceted and complex, but the issue at hand remains the same. Please take a look at the replies.)",2025-05-19 01:05:01,CrohnsDisease,147,1kpzenc,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kpzenc/the_war_on_drugs_could_kill_chronic_illness/,2025-05-19

I am currently on dual biologic therapy (remicade 20mg/kg for 6 years), and just started skyrizi 5 months ago as the disease was fluctuating too much on this insanely high dose of IFX.  I am writing to ask anyone if theyve had majestic experiences after switching to skyrizi for their severe cases.  I read that it offers far more durable remission, and lowered CRP and ESR levels———even long term.  I do have a lot of hope that skyrizi can completely control a severe case but would like to hear from anyone who has experienced it first hand.   I hope everyone has a great day.

483,Skyrizi,My Diagnosis story.,"Hi there, i wanted to share my story of being diagnosed and how i learnt what i had. Im hoping this story might help others feel heard or help them get diagnosed. This is my first time posting on reddit so hopefully this will turn out okay. 

I started having symptoms around may 2024. I had the common loose stools and occasionally stomach pain that turned into constipation. During this i tried to think of anything that could’ve caused it, a flu bug or as i have a uterus i thought it could be PMS symptoms. Unfortunately this kept going on for months, i kept finding possible things that could of caused it. I thought stress, the food i ate, flu, food poisoning, anything that could explain my symptoms. I eventually gave up and accepted that this was just a thing i had, until one time i went to the bathroom and found blood in my stool. Because everyone has always told me blood in the stool is bad i freaked out. I immediately called my doctor and booked an appointment, i explained my symptoms and the moment my doctor heard blood in my stool they got me in for a blood test and stool sample. A couple days after those tests processed i got a call from my doctor saying an urgent colonoscopy is being scheduled for tomorrow, December 11th. I was panicking not knowing what to expect or think as everything was happening so fast and the doctors seemed worried which didn’t help. The next day i went in for my colonoscopy and was thankfully put under to get it done. When i woke up i was unfortunately told the news of my diagnosis, Crohns. Im not sure if it was the anesthesia or the diagnosis but i balled my eyes out at the news, i was told i had to be on medication for the rest of my life. I was crushed, my life felt like it fell apart and all my plans for my future were ruined. I had just turned 18 a couple months prior and was just starting to get my life together, it was hard having this new thing to deal with. My doctors discussed the medication i would be on, Skyrizi. they told me that i would get infusions of the med before doing self injections at home. My first infusion of Skyrizi was in January and i have been on it since. It seems to be working for me but its been a rough battle. Freshly turning 18, getting diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, starting college. Its been a challenge to deal with it all, but thankfully having a strong support group has really helped me get through this. I hope this can help someone feel less alone or heard. Its a tough battle, everyone experiences the disease a little differently but we all know the struggle and helps each other out. 

If anyone is struggling with their disease i want you to know your not alone, there are many of us here to help support you. ",2025-04-21 05:36:50,CrohnsDisease,18,1k464vt,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1k464vt/my_diagnosis_story/,2025-04-21
484,Skyrizi,Benzodiazepines and antihistamines helped my infusion reaction/flare more than any pain meds ever have — just wanted to share this in case it helps anyone else,"I just wanted to share something that happened tonight in case it helps anyone else navigating flares, infusions, and ER care with Crohn’s or other autoimmune stuff.

I had a Skyrizi infusion a few days ago and expected some usual side effects, but things took a pretty sharp turn. I started having intense GI symptoms (severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea), weird urinary symptoms (blood in my urine—but not a typical UTI), and a strange overall dysregulation in my body. My skin was burning hot to the touch for days, but my fever readings stayed normal or just slightly elevated, likely because of how often I was taking Tylenol (literally around the clock). I hadn’t slept, napped, or felt even remotely regulated in three days.

I was incredibly hesitant to go to the ER because I’ve had a string of really frightening experiences recently. One time I came in and they completely missed that I was experiencing severe GI bleeding in both my esophagus and stomach. Another time, I was left unmonitored for nearly 8 hours while slowly heading toward a bowel impaction. It’s been terrifying, and I’ve felt so discouraged and so scared to come back—especially when I don’t “look” critical but something serious is clearly going on.

In those past visits, I’ve often been given heavy pain medications that just leave me foggy, sick, and even less able to rest. I’d leave feeling doped up but not better—like I had a band-aid on a bullet wound. That cycle really made me feel like the ER wasn’t a safe place for me.

But tonight, I finally went in. I couldn’t take it anymore, and honestly, my family and friends were begging me to go. By some stroke of luck, I ended up in a unit where I knew almost every person on staff—they remembered me and knew my history, which made a huge difference. The doctor offered the usual nausea and pain meds, but I told him how opioids usually make me feel worse and asked if we could try something to calm my nervous system instead.

He gave me IV Ativan and Tylenol first, and later antihistamines. And for the first time in days, my body actually started regulating again. My skin wasn’t burning hot. My pain dropped. My nervous system felt like it finally had the chance to reset instead of being dragged along in crisis mode.

They sent me home with a small dose of Xanax to use sparingly, and I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time. Obviously, benzos make you tired, but the difference was staggering. I didn’t feel drugged—I just felt like functionally exhausted if that makes sense. I felt like a person again. And more than anything, I felt safe.

I’m not saying this is the right solution for everyone, but for anyone struggling with flares that feel like full-body system overloads, I think there’s something worth exploring in the use of sedatives and antihistamines to target the nervous system directly—rather than just masking the pain.

I’ve spent a long time feeling afraid to ask for the care I actually need. Tonight reminded me that there are people out there who will listen—and that sometimes a different approach can really change everything.",2025-04-19 07:45:06,CrohnsDisease,17,1k2r1m7,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1k2r1m7/benzodiazepines_and_antihistamines_helped_my/,2025-04-19
485,Skyrizi,Crohn’s and GLP-1 use.,"Just looking for experience from others who have used them. 

I’m 29 and have always had issues with my weight. I’ve never been a huge eater and I don’t really eat much junk food. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and Cohns. Crohn’s official dx (had it for YEARS) in 2024 and hypo was diagnosed later in 2024. I spent most of 2024 on budesinide which didn’t help and I started Skyrizi in July 2024. I still occasionally need the steroids. I also have a hunch I likely have PCOS but never was formally tested. 

I go to a teaching hospital and see a fellowship trained IBD specialist. She referred me to her colleague also fellowship trained in IBD and specializes in IBD and weight management. I’m also managed by their nutrition team. 

I’ve been wanting to lose weight and then we drew my A1C which is a 5.8 which just puts me in the pre-diabetic range. I expressed my concerns about a GLP-1 but my specialists have assured me I’ll be fine - low and slow will be the approach. If I find myself with new GI symptoms or pain, scans will be immediately ordered. I just need to trust in the medical science here. 

I *think* I have a good grasp on what I need to do here in terms of eating, exercising and water intake. I’m not worried about not being hungry, I can’t say I’m overly hungry to begin with. 

Tomorrow’s my first dose (2.5mg) and I am NERVOUS. Any advice/experience that anyone wants to share?

486,Skyrizi,Skyrizi treatment and cyclical symptoms,"Hey everyone! 
I wrote a post back in December when I got my first Skyrizi infusion.
I am now waiting to get my second “at home” subcutaneous injection in May.
I was wondering if anyone else had the same experience as me: right after my first infusion I already was feeling better, mostly fatigue-wise. I still had frequent night sweats, cramps, lots of air, and of course bad bowel movements.
In the following months after every infusion I kept improving, feeling generally more energetic and being able to return to a partially “normal” routine (some more persistent symptoms never left, though for example I was starting to have more solid stools which hadn’t happened in a while).
I noticed that the days prior my infusions were always the worst ones in terms of night sweats/fatigue/etc., I suppose that was because the drug concentration in my body was starting to decrease.
After the third infusion, as per protocol, I had my first injection in March. With skyrizi, after you get the 3 infusions every 4 weeks you have to inject every 8 weeks. 
This is the first time I am waiting 8 weeks for a dose, and right now I’m about two-ish weeks away from my next one.
What I’ve noticed is that at the moment I’ve been having some issues that I haven’t really experienced since before starting the treatment (mostly the smell and consistency of feces, they are kinda reverting back to how they were before. On the other hand, I am not extremely fatigued as I were before starting the treatment, for now I can still study and do what I need to). This is of course making me spiral, thanks to my good old anxiety, thinking that maybe the treatment is failing and it’s not good for me.
So I wanted to ask: is there anyone here on skyrizi/treatments that have “longer” time between injections, that has experienced something similar?
I apologise if my post is a bit unclear, English is not my first language and it was a bit hard to convey what I mean to say.
Thank you all for the attention!!

PS. Just a bonus question for anyone on skyrizi: do you also have insane night sweats in the days following the dose? I’m starting to see a pattern lol

488,Skyrizi,Scar tissue vs skyrizi issues?,"So I have Crohn’s and am currently on Skyrizi, I’ve had 7 surgeries for the Crohn’s over the past several years, 4 abdominal for total colectomy &amp; jpouch and 3 for perianal fistula. I was switched to start on Skyrizi in January 2024 and in March 2024 started to have very pointed spine pain that got severe &amp; very debilitating over the next several months. MRI showed a thoracic herniated disc, which is pretty unusual as it is and even weirder since it came seemingly out of nowhere for me, and which required surgery that I got in November 2024 (laminectomy &amp; discectomy). However now in April 2025 unfortunately I still have yet to experience any amount of pain relief or improvement of other associated symptoms (trouble walking, tingling in the feet/legs, etc). More frequent abdominal &amp; pelvic pain has showed up in more recent months. I have gone through all the treatments - surgery, PT, massage, acupuncture, gabapentin, lyrica, moving, not moving, ice, heat, tens, hot soaks, injections, literally all of it - and have seen all the doctors - pain drs, neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, rheumatologist, endocrinologist, and none of the standard or suggested methods have helped at all. I am unfortunately no stranger to pain and I am all to aware of what pain feels like what and i know that whatever is going on it’s not something simply explainable as muscle pain or nerve pain - I am all too familiar with the quality/characteristics of such pain types to begin with I’ve dealt with muscle &amp; nerve problems for well over 10 years now and thats not the type of pain that has been plaguing me for the past year. 
For those of you who have dealt with post crohns surgery scar tissue problems like adhesions etc that might have required laparoscopy surgery treatment, AND/OR those of you who experienced severe significant back pain that you were able to identify as a side effect and direct result of being on Skyrizi, what did your pain feel like? If you’re comfortable sharing can you please describe what the pain you had felt like and anything else about your experience? I know scar tissue pain vs Skyrizi pain are likely completely different feelings of pain, but having ruled most other possibilities out for my situation, I’m exploring things from this angle (and several others), and if at all possible wanted to try to see if I could match up or associate the type of pain i have with anyone who might have had any similar experience.

492,Skyrizi,Switching from Remicade to Skyrizi,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been living with Crohn’s for about three years and have been on Remicade until last week. It worked well for the first year and a half, but since then, I’ve experienced frequent flares and have been hospitalized seven times. The excruciating pain and the 25+ bowel movements a day during a flare are incredibly difficult to manage.

My GI has now recommended switching to Skyrizi, as it’s clear Remicade is no longer effective for me. I’m hopeful that this new biologic will help bring things under control and also give me more flexibility — especially not having to schedule hospital infusions every six weeks.

I wanted to see if anyone here has made the switch from Remicade to Skyrizi. How has your experience been?

493,Skyrizi,Do you avoid sugar?,"I'm wondering if sugar can aggravate symptoms and maybe cause a mild flare/non-remission to flare up worse....

Diets and trying to figure out trigger foods is so confusing 😩. How are you all with sugar? Do you avoid it? Do you only eat natural sugars, like from fruits and honey? Do you find it worsens symptoms? Do you just avoid highly processed sugars, like high fructose corn syrup, but you're okay with other refined sugar like cane sugar? 

I'm on both Skyrizi and 45mg Rinvoq. 

My diet is all homemade, mainly eggs, chicken, fish, rice, sourdough bread, peanut butter, apple sauce, some steamed veggies are okay, and if I eat fruit its blended in a smoothie. 
Yesterday I tried a (also homemade) muffin. No gluten, no dairy, but it had maple syrup in it (up until then I avoided all sugar except for honey and fruit) and a few chocolate chips. Shortly after my digestive tract started making weird, bubbly feelings and squeezes. Then I saw the smallest amount of pinkish blood when I wiped after a BM (I couldn't see any blood in the actual poop though...). The only thing I could think would cause that is... the sugar. In both the chocolate and muffin itself.

495,Skyrizi,Still feeling bad? Misdiagnosis??,"Is it normal for someone with Crohn's to never have any elevated inflammation markers in blood work or elevated calprotectin? Mine have always been normal. There's other indicators of inflammation in my blood work (high ferratin for example) but I still find it odd that I don't show the classic markers. I was diagnosed by a colonoscopy which found inflammation or my terminal ileum and other ulcers or whatever they are classic to Crohn's, as well as a CT scan which showed intestinal thickening. I'm still always scared however that I was somehow misdiagnosed. Skyrizi has helped some but in other ways I feel worse which leaves me hoping I wasn't misdiagnosed with Crohn's (although that sounds very rare).

I was diagnosed in September 2024 and was on budesonide for a few months. Started Skyrizi in October, and just had my second OBI 3/13. In some ways I'm feeling better - stools are more formed in general, though still fairly loose in the mornings lately. Bowel urgency isn't quite as bad either, though I'm still using the bathroom probably 4-5 times per day. 

Ive been experiencing a lot of nausea on and off for a while now, which wasn't really a consistent symptom that I had before. I also have had a lot of acid (Omeprazole is helping) and feel like I have a lump in my throat. I have had acid reflux my whole life, so this isn't totally out of the ordinary, but I still don't know why it's suddenly so bad. The main thing is I feel like I can't eat anything like I used to. Before I could eat salads with no issues (like even before any treatment/diagnosis), now I can barely eat lettuce or any veggies with thick skin. Same with dairy and fried foods - lately if I eat either I feel like garbage. I was at a point before my diagnosis where pretty much everything made me feel sick, so maybe I'm just noticing specific foods now, but idk I still feel like I need to be more careful than ever when I eat. 

I have a colonoscopy/egd next Monday so we'll see if there's any improvement. I don't know how to feel about it. Obviously I want to see improvement, but if there has been improvement, why am I still feeling so shitty? My mental health has been awful for months which I'm sure is contributing to my symptoms. But they're also very much tied to how I'm feeling (tummy hurts = depressed).  This whole experience has been extremely emotionally taxing and I just want to start feeling better.

496,Skyrizi,My Crazy Prednisone Story,"Does anyone else have any horror stories about Prednisone? I was on Pentasa from the time I was originally diagnosed at 20 until I lost my health insurance after graduating college at 22. After getting my health insurance back right after turning 24, I found a GI in the area that I had moved to and she was confused about why the only medication I had been on so far was Pentasa (since it’s usually used to treat Ulcerative Colitis). She mentioned going on Prednisone which was something that I had never heard of before. A couple days after this appointment, I’m at work one evening and I have the worst flare up that I have ever had in the four years of having Crohn’s Disease. I can barely walk and I’m clutching my stomach, while customers are asking if I’m okay. I get sent home and my boyfriend takes me to the emergency room. At the emergency room, they do a CT scan and give me morphine for the pain. The CT scan shows severe inflammation and I tell the doctor about how my new GI mentioned going on Prednisone as the new course of action. He gives me Prednisone there and I am sent home with Hydrocodone for when the pain gets bad again. Basically just putting a bandaid over the problem of inflammation, but there’s not much that can be done in the moment. My GI sends over the Prednisone prescription after this and I pick it up at my local pharmacy. The days for Prednisone all go down by .5 mg every four days and starts with 4 tablets. So basically just breaking them in half when the dose ended in .5. The length of time that I was supposed to be taking each one was around 5 days for each, except the 3.5 dose was supposed to be taken for 55 days. I follow the directions for the doses and I start to feel better at first. I go to England to stay with my friend from college and her family, and I have flare up after flare up while there and I am taking the 3.5 dose for an extended period of time. I think it’s because of my travel anxiety and change to my diet. I start to see acne forming all over my chest and neck. It starts to spread to my face when I get home, along with my face swelling up and looking a lot rounder than it ever has. Acne has never been an issue for me and I am confused on why so much is happening at once. I start to experience a change in appetite where I am hungry all the time, which has not happened since I was a teenager and I gain ten pounds (which is something that I like since having an appetite has been a struggle with Crohn’s). I am also feeling sick the entire time I am on vacation because my immune system is weakened. When I get back home, I have an appointment with my GI and I talk to her about how I’m doing with the Prednisone and that I’m now on day 30 something of the 3.5 dose. She looks confused at first and then checks my chart and says, “oh that was a typo. It was supposed to say 5 days, not 55 days.” She continues on as normal and says that it was probably good that I was on it for extra longer because my body needed it. I’m confused because it seems like a steroid like this should not be taken for that long, but she tells me that I can’t just go off it and that I need to taper. In the coming weeks of me tapering down the Prednisone, I notice tons of rashes all over my body that I just have to deal with because there’s nothing I can do about it. Finally, I’m done with Prednisone and slowly my body starts to go back to normal, except for the acne. This was back in December last year when it ended, and my acne has faded but since it’s hormonal acne, it has been hard to get rid of entirely. I don’t know if being on Prednisone longer than what was supposed to happen made my side effects worse or if I will have long term damage because of that, but this was just the general outline of my Prednisone story. That GI doesn’t work in the office anymore and I have a new one that is helping me get Skyrizi. She asked me if I wanted to go back on Prednisone before the Skyrizi, since Skyrizi kind of takes a while to get back on approved by insurance and I said that I didn’t think I could handle the side effects again. I am now taking Budesonide until I start Skyrizi. Anyways, I just thought I would share that story and see if anyone else has bad experiences with Prednisone.",2025-04-09 17:12:32,CrohnsDisease,1,1jvb41e,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jvb41e/my_crazy_prednisone_story/,2025-04-09
499,Skyrizi,Concerns about starting Skyrizi while transitioning from Infliximab,"I was diagnosed with fistulizing Crohn's in March of 2020 when I was 15 and immediately started Remicade before being put on Infliximab mid 2021. Around 2022, my dose was doubled and I started experiencing side effects such as medically-induced inverse psoriasis due to a reaction that was caused by an excess of TNF-a inhibitors in my system. I was scared to switch medications but eventually folded a few months backs and decided to try Skyrizi. I had my first dose a little under a week ago and am worried the medications effectiveness as I've heard it's highly effective or completely useless. My last dose of Infliximab was 2 months prior to my first Skyrizi infusion and I'm curious to hear others experience with Crohn's, medically induced psoriasis, and the transition period from Infliximab to Skyrizi and it's effectiveness on similar issues. My doctor said it can take 3 months to a year for my psoriasis to heal, but I'm worried the medication might be ineffective against my Crohn's as I'm already experiencing hemorrhoid's and fissures.

500,Skyrizi,Immunosuppressed/compromised - what does that mean? (Brain abscess story),"I, 53F, was diagnosed with Crohn's in March 2022.  Started Remicade in August 2022, discovered in December 2024 that Remicade wasn't working and GI doc recommended that I switch to Skyrizi.  Had first induction dose on Feb 21st, started getting headache on Feb 23rd.  Since I was told that headache is a common side affect, I didn't worry for the first 48 hours, even though it was increasing in severity.  Reached out to multiple medical professionals for guidance, wasn't able to get a response as to whether what I was experiencing was normal.  Noticed that my vision was going wonky, saw a primary care physician and was told that headaches can cause vision problems and maybe I should see an optometrist. By Feb 28th, it was bad enough that I went to the ER where I was told that I had a brain abscess and that I needed to have surgery immediately.  I thought I recovered and went home, starting IV antibiotic therapy (2x daily).  Two weeks later I was back in the ER with headaches and on March 15th I had a second brain abscess drainage surgery.   I'm now home and continuing the IV antibiotics.  Recent MRI and CT scans look promising, but my neuro says I'm not out of the woods yet.   My vision is about 40% impaired, but I'm hopeful that will improve as my brain swelling subsides.  

  
My questions:

1.  My GI doc told me that Remicade and Skyrizi are not to be blamed, since those meds aren't systemic immunosuppression but localized suppression.  All the guidance for these meds strongly warn about ""risk of serious infection"".  I would have thought that brain infection would fall in that category.  For people with science/medical knowledge and background, what is your understanding of how immunosuppression of these meds work?  I'm not looking for anecdotal experiences (e.g. ""I feel like I'm catching more colds""), hoping to gain a better understanding of how these meds impact the the immune system.

2.  The bacteria that caused the abscess is a common mouth bacteria.  I had a dental cleaning nine weeks prior to my Skyrizi induction dose.  All the docs want to blame the abscess on the dental cleaning, but I'm skeptical.  When I first asked the neurosurgeon how long it would take for an abscess my size to form, he said 3 to 5 days, which falls within the window of the Skyrizi induction dose.  Again, for people with a medical/science background, what are your thoughts are timeline?  Is it reasonable to believe that I had an infection in my brain/body for eight weeks without showing any other signs?  And that the timing of the Skyrizi induction dose is coincidental?

  
For everyone, if you are starting a new med, please be sure to fully understand the severity and duration of the side effects.  I waited too long to seek treatment because I didn't know what was normal.  Don't be me!

I had a small bowel resection \~1 month ago to remove a stricture. 3 days before that, I started to experience a lump in my throat when I swallow, and tightness in my chest.

  
Since after the surgery (and after starting Skyrizi), I am still experiencing these symptoms. Has anyone dealt with this before? I'm sure it is related to Crohn's. My doctor said it could be related to GERD but I feel Prilosec hasn't helped me (tried taking on and off).

I'm noticing that lettuce absolutely tears me up, which doesn't sound like it's uncommon for Crohn's, but I feel like I used to be able to eat salads with no issues. Granted, there was a period before I was diagnosed that literally everything I ate would mess me up so it's possible I just didn't notice, but it was still shocking to me that even a little lettuce from a sandwich or wrap can hurt me so much. 

I'm guessing I'm still in a flare (colonoscopy will confirm next month if there's been any improvement from the Skyrizi). But, when someone is in remission, can they generally eat somewhat normally again? I love raw veggies so it's sad to think that I may not be able to eat them anymore, even if I'm eventually in remission.

I know that appetite increase is a thing that can happen with some medication but I don't think Skyrizi is one of those, or at least I can't find anyone talking about it.

  
Only two explanations I can think of is either 

A. My body's finally trying to heal and beans more nutrients and protein than normal to do the young or

B. My appetite was suppressed but it was so big to start with it didn't really feel like it was, and now the bottomless pit me from my youth has returned. Well I suspect that I had this condition for most of my life, I think it's only been in the moderate to severe point in the last handful of years. And back before things started to take a real decline I used to be the person that everybody would pass there leftovers to at the table.

  
And it might not be either of those things I don't know, if anybody has insight on the similar experiences that would be greatly appreciated.

511,Skyrizi,The Best Thing To Ever Happen To Me,"Mid-February, I spent eleven days at the UChicago Hospital in Hyde Park, Chicago. I had a flare after failing Skyrizi.

The inflammation had gotten so bad that it caused an intestinal blockage. NG tube down my throat, catheter, and to cap it off my appendix burst - causing them to send me to an emergency exploratory surgery that night. The next morning, I woke up with a complete colectomy. Now I’ll live with an ileostomy for the rest of my life. Nearly kicked the bucket!

Three weeks post op, I have never felt better. I’d been living with active Crohn’s for years, and though there’s still challenges and difficulties (and boy does an ileostomy look freaky!) I feel like those surgeons have given me a chance to live the happy, healthy, and complicated life they saved. Having the ileostomy kinda rocks! 

It was terrifying, and painful, but I learned that I’m a lot stronger than I thought I was. I feel like I have a fresh perspective on the world. I’m back at work, going on dates, forcing my friends to carry anything heavier than 10lbs, and most of all… I’m okay.

To any folks new to Crohn’s here, this subreddit is a great resource, and it’s also very scary. You’re likely to find a treatment option(s) that work well for you and live happily and healthily. And if you don’t find one, you’ll still likely be able to live happily and healthily - like me.

You’re in for a ride; I cannot promise you’ll have a good one. Mine certainly has been bumpy haha, but there’s a community of people here for you, and you’re a lot stronger than you think you are.

Thought some positivity may be helpful on here! Of course, everyone has different experiences with their care, ileostomy, etc and the last thing I want to do is minimize anyone who’s had a negative experience with these procedures. If you  have any questions about my experience/recovery, I’m 100% an open book. Would love to hear from other people about their experiences with ileostomies. I’m here for anyone who needs it.

I took all the biologics and was on cortisone for years. The hope was that I would be free of medication after the operation as my small intestine was always free of inflammation. Unfortunately, that didn't work and my small intestine showed signs of inflammation. 

Anyway, I am now taking Skyrizi (again). I have now had the first three infusions and have an unbearable headache, especially in the morning, which subsides as the day goes on. Have any of you had this experience and has it possibly improved after the first phase of treatment? Or perhaps the headache has another cause that needs to be clarified.

513,Skyrizi,"Diagnosed a year ago, adding a diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis, and changing biologics","A year ago I (32F) was diagnosed with crohns and started Entyvio infusions. I wasn’t responding to the every 8 week infusions so we increased the frequency to 6 weeks and I’ve had a huge improvement of symptoms but still haven’t achieved remission. But as my GI symptoms got better I realized how bad my joint pain was and rheumatology diagnosed me with axial spondyloarthritis a couple of months ago. 

I just left my GI appointment and they along with rheum are wanting to switch me to either Skyrizi or Remicade to cover the SpA since Entyvio is just GI specific. I’m all on board and can’t wait to get full coverage of my symptoms and maybe get into remission. I’m still struggling with anal fissures, pain with eating, low grade temps and night sweats. And of course the joint pain and ridiculous fatigue. 

Rheumatology and what insurance will cover will be the final decision between the meds. But I was wondering if anyone else has a similar experience of switching from Entyvio to one of these to cover systemic symptoms and what your experience was? Or peoples experience with these meds in general and their improvements

I find it so awkward how the infusion clinic has 0 privacy.

- being asked personal medical questions out in the open.  
(uncomfortable asking questions. I don’t like disclosing medications or health conditions to strangers — who are all there for different reasons)

- being instructed to self inject in a room of people feels very very weird ? (room full of old men too 💀)

-  Also, in my experience, I’m the youngest and gayest and only female in the room lol.  


No one wears masks either ( including the nurses ! ) despite us all sitting extremely close and being immunocompromised?? The website says masks are mandatory but I’m the only one who wears one.

^ ironic bc i asked a nurse how i can prevent getting sick and she said make sure i wear a mask in public 💀

I’m sure everyone has different experiences but where I live every health care professional wears a mask so this is odd to me.

What happens if I get offered a new job and subsequently lose my current insurance while the new one kicks in? Most company insurances take like 30 days to begin after enrollment, but by the time that happened AND the Skyrizi got approved, I would’ve definitely missed a dose. My symptoms are pretty severe so I hate to wait, but I imagine it’d be worst case scenario to have one of the IV infusions later than the 4 week mark.

Prednisone worked for the first three months after diagnosis, but after that my symptoms started coming back. 
I was on Entyvio. Failed. 
Rinvoq. Terrible side effect/reaction. Failed.
Prednisone again. This time reacted terribly. Failed. 
Antibiotics. Some worked for a bit but quickly lost affect. 
Budesonide (currently on). Doesn't seem to be working. 
Remicade/Inflectra. Failed. Sort of. Here's the weird thing about my infliximab experience: my blood tests and  inflammatory markers went significantly down, but my symptoms were still raging. I had a CRP of 1 but cramping bloody diarrhea multiple times daily. Idk why. Could it have been a reaction to the biologics itself? Idk. 

But recently I've come down with a full blown flare up. CRP and calprotectin got high. Infliximab obviously isn't working anymore (not like it was working well before either...). 
My GI put in an order for me to start Skyrizi, but said that won't be available until another three weeks! I can't go three weeks with a raging flare. Budesonide isn't doing anything. I need any natural tips/diets/supplements that you've tried that can work.

532,Skyrizi,Biologic Questions,"Backstory: I was diagnosed with Crohn’s when I was 18 after 3 years of horrible flair ups and no answers. I was put on mesalamine (along with on/off usage of steroids) and in my early twenties my Crohn’s became ‘mild’ and I’ve lived a relatively normal life since then other than a flare up in 2018. Prior to 2018 my Crohn’s was predominantly confined to my ilium, but after the flare I now experience what I consider mild symptoms throughout my entire digestive tract. My symptoms now primarily consist of ulcers in the back of my throat, perianal ulcers, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and occasional bloody stool. Compared to my teens and early twenties the pain I experience is mild and I only have these symptoms once every couple of months. 

I started seeing a new PA a couple of years ago and she has been pushing for me to switch from mesalamine to a biologic. Honestly, I was hesitant out of fear and some imposter syndrome since my Crohn’s has been so mild and I had a gastro a few years prior question whether I had Crohn’s due to a clear colonoscopy (only met the guy for the colonoscopy and never saw him again). 

Over the last couple of months my symptoms have started to occur on a more frequent basis and I agreed to move to a biologic (Skyrizi). My initial infusion was scheduled for next week, but I was informed today the appointment was canceled and I needed to have a colonoscopy and some blood work done (now scheduled for the end of this month).

533,Skyrizi,Rinvoq vs Skyrizi - what should I go with?,"I've been on Remicade or a biosimilar since my diagnosis in 2021 but it likely I have stopped responding to the medication sometime over the last 6 months with the recent increase in inflammation in my ileum/small bowel.  I had a surgery in October 2023 to remove it all but looks like it's back already.

My GI gave me the choice of going with Rinvoq or Skyrizi as my next steps to bring the inflammation down to where I was earlier last year. What's everyone's experience between these two options? I was rarely sick with Remicade and little side effects. 

Rinvoq seems easier from an application perspective, taking a daily pill vs 3 loading doses and self injections with Skyrizi (not a big fan of that). But since I'm only 3-4 years into this disease and already off the gold standard medication, I want to make sure I go with something that will work long term. 

I'm going to be put on Budesonide for the next 30 days to help with symptoms till I make a call on what I want to do next.

for extra context: I have an ileostomy and have complications so I take pain medication on and off. crohns for 15+ yrs and on my last available biologic (skyrizi)! would love a GI who isn’t judgemental of pain care (I have a pain management doc so I don’t need prescription help) and is also HELPFUL with stoma health and will work with a colorectal surgeon (also open to surgeon recs!)

I have read that you are automatically enrolled and have to call to opt out. If I send CVS my skyrizi payment card info, will they process it through prudentRX?

Some more background: I had some weird symptoms earlier in the year (persistent high fevers, night sweats, rashes) that ended in a referral to a hematologist/oncologist, but the heme/onc said I could wait to see if the symptoms resolved after Skyrizi before proceeding with the CT scans, and they mostly have improved. I've been on Skyrizi for about 8 months now and I'm finally starting to look like my old self again (which is really exciting)! But I'm actually a little concerned because I started to lose more weight than I wanted to/expected, despite eating...not great. I probably eat pastries 4x a week and I snack a lot. I know it's bad, but it's been exciting to be able to eat normally again so I get a bit overzealous sometimes lol.  So: does anyone else tend to *lose* weight in remission rather than gain?

I only ask cause most of the research and publications out their reference stories of adult IBD journeys or therapies and depending on the medical team few pediatrics get lucky maybe to access those options. Just wondering if anyone has any insights, because I am planning to ask my care provider for that as the next attempt to bring the child to a remission which was never a success with all the previous combinations of medications for past 4 years since diagnosis.

565,Skyrizi,Advice for New Crohn's Patient,"Hi, Crohn's Community!

I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's after less than a year of experiencing symptoms and wanted to get your experience on the next diagnosis steps.

Background

I'm a young adult who tries to be healthy (eats whole foods, limited red meat and processed foods, has a good sleep schedule, is physically active, and takes care of my mental health).

This year, I experienced symptoms of stomach pain (sharp and dull) in LRQ/LLQ and belly button area, constipation, lack of appetite, feeling tired, nausea, random chest pain, joint pain, lower back pain, and temperature swings.

Also, this year has been **incredibly stressful** for me because of various events impacting all aspects of life, which has gone beyond anything I have experienced.

I have had imaging (Ulta sounds and CT Scans) done that detected swelling, as well as a colonoscopy with a biopsy. In addition to these blood tests and stool tests, c-reactive protein (testing inflammation) came back slightly high, around 150, and stool test around 500 when having what I think was a flare. I was prescribed Mesalamine for roughly a month, then Budesonide after no improvement from the previous medication. I am currently on Prednisone, starting around 40 mg, then tapering slowly, and have gotten recent imaging (MRI) done that shows everything is normal. Being on Prednisone, I haven't had any pain in my stomach; just experiencing the side effects of the medication (mostly mental/head-related). I have been trying to do anything additional that could help, such as taking required vitamins (B12, D, A, K, E, Iron, Folic Acid, and Calcium) from food or supplements depending on what is needed, incorporating turmeric into my diet more, practicing better stress management, looking into red light therapy, stretching/yoga, and avoiding flaring causing foods currently.

I met with a specialist, and they think I have ileocolonic Crohn's disease and need to go on IV treatments, specifically Skyrizi (3 infusions for 3 months), then transition to self-injections every two months.

Thoughts

To my understanding, I will have to continue to do the self-injections for the rest of my life, which makes me feel a little uneasy. Also, I have small veins, and multiple bad experiences with getting IVs and needles have left me with a lot of anxiety around this process (to the point where I physically shake and start crying). I respect the provider's opinion but am curious to hear others' thoughts. Additionally, I want to make clear that I am not opposed to Western medicine but would prefer if I didn't need to be dependent on medication and be exposed to unwanted side effects.



\- Do you all think that the diagnosis of continuous treatment seems reasonable?

\- Should they wait to see how I do when I am off Prednisone?

\- Any additional solutions people saw with alternative treatments for their Crohns?

570,Skyrizi,No idea where to start,"So, just got diagnosed with mild Crohns in my terminal ileum after a colonoscopy (35m).

I’ve had tummy troubles my whole life and always assumed it was IBS but never actually saw a gastro until this year.

When I was in college and in my teens, my stomach was a train wreck. I’d be in the bathroom for 30-45 mins at a time, missing class, in tons of pain every time I had a BM.

Then I discovered probiotics and started eating healthy (vegetarian, whole grains, minimal processed foods) and basically completely rid myself of any issues with rare exceptions.

Now since my colonoscopy (which I only decided to get because why not - insurance said they would cover it) and diagnosis, I all of a sudden have had constant mild cramping, non stop bloating and constant discomfort basically every day. I’m afraid of what I’m eating, and probiotics aren’t working.

My doc wants me to start Skyrizi. I’ve already tried budesonide and prednisone with no luck.

I’m pretty freaked out - how did I go from totally under control for 10 plus years to needing this intense immune suppression medication with scary potential side effects?

Has anyone here had a similar experience? 

And does anyone have tips on what to do?? Should I try a more intense probiotic like VSL #3 first, should I try an elimination diet, or should I just dive into the biologic treatment?

It feels like this escalated so quickly. I have two young kids and don’t want to risk anything unnecessary. And I don’t want to be sick more than I already am with the constant daycare virus game.

Now I am scared that I screwed up with Skyrizi. Does anyone have experience, good or bad, with this that they can share?

However, it started getting worse/better but generally I felt okay (I won’t be able to contact GI or psychiatrist till Monday)

My GI suggested on me taking antidepressants so I went to psychiatrist and started taking Bupropion (Wellbutrin) 150mg XL , after 2 days I started getting more mucus and it continues till now (day 11), I’ve heard that bupropion may induce remission from some clinical research but can it be related to worsening symptoms?

576,Rinvoq,Anyone have similar experiences?,"Lost access to Rinvoq for a few weeks due to insurance issues and recently moving so didn’t have a new GI yet. I fell into a flare during that time. By the time I got back on Rinvoq, I went back to the loading dose. No results for the first 10 weeks, absorption issues with other nutrients, so likely wasn’t getting my proper dosage of Rinvoq during that time as well. Finally got my GI to prescribe steroids and symptoms completely disappeared after about a week and a half. Stayed on the loading dose for 6 more weeks (16 total) and then went down to 30mg (was on 15mg originally). 

After finishing my prednisone taper, I had some mild symptoms come back and labs are showing mild inflammation again. Symptoms are much milder than before and have been stable for a few weeks now. GI wants to call Rinvoq a failure and move on, but I’m not sure I’m ready to give up on it. I’ve never seen that kind of improvement from prednisone before, and I’m definitely responding to the Rinvoq to some extent, so I’m wondering if maybe we were just too quick to reduce my dosage.

578,Rinvoq,Leukocytoclastic vasculitis,"I developed this after COVID while on remicade. Remicade kept me well and in remission for 17 years. The rheumatologist thought it was super rare for remicade to cause the vasculitis , so over 3 years I tried colchicine, prednisone, methotrexate, and imuran. The vasculitis flares always came back- they were started to get painful. Also had microscopic hematuria throughout. Did a work up with nephrology and urology and found no causes. Finally I asked my GI to switch off the remicade and he agreed. 
Went on Entyvio, went into horrible flare, hospitalization. Scope and then on Rinvoq. Had to add cortiment recently and will repeat scope in a month because not sure if it’s working well for me. 
The vasculitis seemed to really stop temporarily once I went on Entyvio, but over the last couple months it seems to reoccur. Nowhere near the level of before but basically petichaie all the way down my legs. 
Wondering if others have had vasculitis caused by the Anti TNF inhibitors and how long did it continue as you transitioned to other meds? 
I wonder if the fact that my Crohn’s is not controlled is now driving it?

I live on Ontario, Canada and was prescribed Rinvoq by my Gastro in early October.

I was curious if this is normal, and what folks did to potentially help the situation?

I have a caseworker, but each time I ask about the status of my prescription, she mentions they are awaiting my GIs approval. When I asked again a few days after, she mentioned they were awaiting the results of my TB test, etc. The reason changes every time I message her. When I checked in with my GIs office, they mentioned they received no faxes asking for approval or extra information.

Is it normal to have this entire process spanning 3+ weeks? I'm having a hard time understanding why they contact me so much (usually multiple texts weekly, 5+ calls) to verify my address over and over again, however there's little to no progress on my prescription being approved.

I got a Calprotectin test that was elevated (214, which isn't outrageously high but still well above the \~50 average) and higher than it was when I had just finished my 12 week taper off Prednisone earlier in the year (169 about 6 months ago). I met with my GI yesterday and it was suggested I go back on the loading dose and stay there, then test the stool in about 6 weeks. If the levels are still elevated, she'll do a scope and if there's still lots of inflammation, she said we'll need to discuss switching to a different biologic.

I've been dealing with this flare for nearly a year now. I finally felt like I found something that was working and now this. I've been back to work, eating pretty much anything I want, sleeping well, exercising vigorously and generally going back to my life as I lived it when I was in a deep remission for 8.5 years prior to failing Remicade.

I still feel mostly symptomatically fine, but I'm remembering I was able to do all these things prior to the flare getting worse and I'm concerned about that happening.

I was on rinvoq since feb 2024 which worked a treat, but had a bit of a liver scare with abnormal function tests (was told i could have possibly developed a secondary autoimmune disease of the liver) fell into a deep depression (never happened before and was absolutely awful!)
stopped taking meds for about 3 months (stupid i know!) 
Had MRCP scan and specialists couldn’t find anything concerning but still have referred me to a hepatologist. 

ANYWAYS long story short, 
I fell pregnant whilst off meds which completely shocked myself and hubby due to being told pregnancy would be a struggle for me! but it was the best suprise ever! This is my first pregnancy. 

I am about 8 weeks, everythings gone okay so far and I am about to start stellara next week. Has anyone’s crohns symptoms disappeared during pregnancy? When I’m in active disease I am usually running to loo about 20 times a day and have severe joint paint, but during pregnancy I literally am lucky if i maybe go loo once every 3 days. 
I feel great apart from first trimester fatigue and a tiny bit of nausea/vomiting etc. 

Just wondering if any other crohnies would be comfortable to share their experiences with pregnancy and stellara? :)

I was diagnosed with mild Crohn’s in February of this year. After a taper of prednisone and starting the max dose of Mesalamine, I was in remission back to normal from March to June. 

Then I got a cold, bam, flare ever since then. Blood and all. Two rather unsuccessful prednisone tapers later, I’m expecting to be switched to a new medication. 

I wanted to know your journeys with meds. I’m afraid of needles but I know biologics are typically the next step, so I’ll have to get over it. 

I would’ve liked Rinvoq, but I’m afraid that since I’m 21, I might enjoy many years of remission on it then decide to have children, then I’ll have to stop it and risk a flare. That does not sound fun… it seems like a medication I should save for AFTER kids?

Within the first week I noticed persistent leg pain and went to urgent care as I thought it might be an effect of the Shingrix vaccine I got along with the medication. The doctor examined me and said he didn't see or notice any abnormalities in my bone structure, circulation or blood. He implied ""myalgia"" was not an atypical response to a vaccine or strong new medication.

After the leg pain subsided, I started feeling chest tightness which is typically in my upper left side near where my shoulder and pectoral connect. It is never near my heart and my BPM/blood pressure/blood oxygen and everything seems to be normal. I'm not unable to lift things, don't feel especially weak in the areas where it manifests but it's noticeable and persistent. It can go from one side of my sternum to the other and it's difficult if not impossible to pinpoint what is triggering it or when. 

I've spoken with my PCP and gone to urgent care anytime I feel something abnormal and they all essentially suggest the same thing as with the leg pain - my body is adapting and this is how I'm feeling that.

I tried 45mg Rinvoq pills for two weeks, then experienced my first ever GI bleed quite badly.  The bleeding stopped after we paused Rinvoq;  then after restarting on Rinvoq for 5 days, again the bleeding started.  I then switched to 40mg prednisone, and after about 12 days, I had GI bleeding again.

I am not an MD or a science expert.  As a patient, I am trying to understand the cause and effect; and the reason...  If prednisone is shutting off my body's immune system, then what is attacking the GI to cause bleeding?  Could it be a pathogen that can now launch an attack?  And how do you adjust the treatment?    Do you discontinue or lower the dose of the immunomodulator, or try another drug entirely (assuming we have not run out of options)?  Or might you consider a round of broad spectrum antibiotics to kill off whatever pathogen in the GI tract?

Everyone's path on this journey differs and what is right for one patient may differ for others.

627,Rinvoq,In Need of Support/Reassurance,"First time poster, long time lurker. I was diagnosed with Crohn's back in 2022 although I struggled with symptoms throughout most of my teens and 20s. I'm currently on Remicade (monthly infusion at the maximum dose) and I also had a hemicolectomy in March. Even with all of this, I'm still experiencing many of the same symptoms (nausea, alternating constipation and diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating, fatigue, and joint pain). My life seems to follow this general pattern: a few days to a week of flare-ups, followed by a brief period of improvement, and then the symptoms return. This has been more or less consistent since my surgery, even with the addition of budesonide to try and get things under control.

The thing that's messing with my head is that all my numbers look great. All my inflammation markers are either normal or way down from where they used to be. My doctor has mentioned the possibility of switching to another medication (Rinvoq) if symptoms don't improve and I'm thinking about reaching out to him and asking to switch. But part of me is worried that I'm just being dramatic or that this is just what I have to deal with because I have Crohn's. 

I miss who I was before my diagnosis (I used to play tennis for 2+ hours with no problem and now I struggle to have the energy to walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes). I want to get to a place where I'm feeling better and having the energy to do all the things I want to do. But maybe that's not realistic and I need to just accept that. So if anyone has any advice or suggestions, I would really appreciate it. And if anyone has made the switch to Rinvoq, what has that experience been like?",2025-07-10 19:00:41,CrohnsDisease,3,1lwl2pd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lwl2pd/in_need_of_supportreassurance/,2025-07-10

due to severe side effects but overall remission my boyfriends doc recommended he’d quit his biologics treatment last year and well, shit is hitting the fan and the Crohns is back.

1. go back to the same biologics 
2. take the Rinvoq pill (it contains Upadacitinib - at least that’s my best effort deciphering the doc‘s hand writing, lol)
3. a Shot of Risankizumab (same thing here) every 8 weeks.

She thinks since this is my 3rd biologic that another (vedolizumab) won't work enough, just like the other ones. She told me they wanted to put me on Rinvoq. I've been in shock, since I also feel like this makes me getting closer to needing surgery someday.

They said they don't know the long-term risks in general either, but I've read on here that with the starting dose there's acne involved? I'm already prone to skin problems so that's quite a big concern of mine.

646,Rinvoq,Pain Medicine and Crohn's disease,"**Hi everyone,**

I'm hoping for some advice or shared experiences. Here's what's been going on:

* I'm currently on **Rinvoq (JAK Inhibitor)**, which has helped my rectum, colon, and small intestines a lot — though not completely. I also need a **higher-than-normal dose** to keep things controlled. (I've already been through and failed all biologics available):
* **Extra-intestinal complications** have been very tough lately:
   * Past: pleuritic inflammation (chest pain), small fiber neuropathy (nerve damage).
   * Current: **severe scalp inflammation** and **painful mouth ulcers** (ulcers, skin tags).
* **Mouth issues** are somewhat manageable (cold sore treatments helping slowly).
* **Scalp pain** is **debilitating**, worst from **2–6 AM**, worsened by stress, and contributing to my needing disability leave.

**Pain management struggle:**

* **Acetaminophen doesn't help.**
* **Ibuprofen helps** a little at high doses but flares my Crohn’s badly.
* **ER visits** provided temporary relief (morphine and steroid shots), but I was sent home with **no prescriptions** or long-term pain management plan.
* I rarely need pain meds (only surgeries, blockages, severe flares before), and I’m very careful not to overuse or risk addiction.

**Current dilemma:**

* **Moderate-severe pain** but **can't get prescriptions**.
* **Topical treatments** (like steroid creams) are **not working** for scalp lesions.
* Systemic steroids (**prednisone**) help slowly.
* **Biopsies** were done last week — possible future treatment may include meds used for psoriasis.

**Questions for you all:**

* Have you **seen a pain specialist** for Crohn’s-related extra-intestinal pain? Was it helpful?
* What has helped you when **pain was unmanageable** but **prescription pain meds** were hard to get?
* Any tips for dealing with **scalp inflammation** pain safely?

I know the best long-term solution is **controlling the inflammation**, but meanwhile the **pain has been disabling** at times, and I’m looking for anything that could help.

Thank you so much for any advice or experiences you can share. 🙏

647,Rinvoq,Had to stop Rinvoq for 10 days due to insurance,"Hello

Quick question, I have taken Rinvoq for 10 months. Been at 10 mg a day for almost 5 months. Not sure if is helping but I don't think it is hurting me either. Unfortunately still have acne on my face which is super annoying at age 50.

Anyways had an issue with my insurance and had to stop taking Rinvoq for 10 days. Insurance issues got fixed, got the monthly allotment of Rinvoq and took my 1st 10mg pill yesterday.

Will it take a few days to start working again? I really didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms although I think I had to go to the bathroom a little more. Not even sure to be honest with you. I was worried I would have bad flare ups of my crohns and I really didn't.

What do you think? I'm gonna keep taking it once a day again and just act like the 10 day pause never happened lol.",2025-04-25 11:19:44,CrohnsDisease,1,1k7ifsp,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1k7ifsp/had_to_stop_rinvoq_for_10_days_due_to_insurance/,2025-04-25
648,Rinvoq,Trust yourself and go to the ER when in doubt,"I'm just going to give a quick overview of my experience to help others understand how important is to trust yourself and go to the ER when you think you need to! (Coming from someone who usually doesn't take pain seriously).

I've had Crohn's for a while and never been in remission so I am very used to severe pain and fatigue. I've also been on ER trips that feel worthless and just serve to ease the pain for a bit and they can't do anything else to help. Due to having a couple of these trips I am terrified to go to the ER because I always feel like I'm being dramatic. I started Rinvoq about 2 weeks ago and started feeling icky. I just blamed it on a reaction to the Rinvoq. Yesterday night I woke up in severe pain and thought it was just gas pain. I tried to sleep and power through but couldn't. I waited 5 hours before the pain became too much, 9 out of 10. But I was still doubting myself and didn't want to be dramatic. Finally I was in so much pain and just wanted to make it stop and didn't care if I was being dramatic and went to the ER. They did the CT scan and turns out yes my Crohn's was bad but I needed an emergency appendectomy. They set up time to schedule the surgery same day and while waiting for surgery my appendix ruptured. I am so very grateful that I gave in and went to the emergency room. They got me in and out of surgery and I'm in recovery now! Had I continued to ignore my pain my appendix could have ruptured while I was at home, when it ruptures your pain stops for a little bit and it feels like things are getting better, So I would have carried on and just thought I was in a horrible flare up and it was getting better. So please please take pain seriously and take care of yourself even if it turns out just be your Crohn's you deserve to be heard and not in pain ❤️‍🩹

TLDR; Went to the emergency room for severe very Crohn's like pain ended up needing emergency appendectomy and appendix ruptured while waiting for surgery.

665,Rinvoq,How long did it take for you to stabilize &amp; show significant improvement after starting Rinvoq?,"Hospitalized with a bad flare, somewhat stable currently on methylprednisolone 60mg, at 2.5 weeks of Rinvoq.

Doctors characterize my situation so far as ""mild improvement"", but my concern right now is that I'm having severe bleeding events every few days, initial day of which was bad enough that it required a blood transfusion. They want to see how PO prednisone 50mg goes to try to see if I'm stable enough to work towards discharge, but the level of bleeding is not sustainable IMO outside of hospitalization.

**How long did it take you to feel &amp; be stable enough to at least be at home on Rinvoq? Anyone else experience bleeding events?** I don't want to leave the hospital too early and/or with a poorly planned path forwards and have to turn around and come back, especially given how inhibiting this is to the rest of my life right now. Doctors are open to other treatment plans even if they're leaning Rinvoq &amp; PO prednisone at the moment.

EDIT: determined that I failed medical therapy on day 21. Lack of significant response/improvement in symptoms and side effects, including severe pain not addressable even by opiates. Surgery imminent, sigmoid resection, almost guaranteed temporary stoma bag for recovery before reconnection surgery.

674,Rinvoq,Is United Health screwing me over by refusing to count Rinvoq assistance towards deductible?,"Hi folks,

I am a Crohns’s patient on Rinvoq. This is the first calendar year I’ve started while on Rinvoq. While all the other meds I’ve been on in the past have had financial assistance that counted towards my deductible/OOPM, United Healthcare is saying that it’s their “policy” that they don’t count assistance from Rinvoq Complete towards the deductible/OOPM (I have a high deductible health plan, so this substantially affects my budget). I had a three way call with United and CVS Caremark (the pharmacy benefit manager), and CVS says that according to them the $3300 Rinvoq Complete paid SHOULD count towards my deductible, and that United made a specific adjustment on their end to deny this. I have researched and understand the basics of copay accumulator/copay maximizer programs and am also aware that as of sometime in 2023 copay accumulator programs are supposed to be illegal at the federal level and all assistance MUST count towards the deductible unless the med has a generic equivalent. They are also illegal in my state, but my health plan is through my partner’s employer, so I understand there might be some complication there depending on what state his health plan is technically based in (it’s a large national company).

When I read the resources that Crohns/Colitis foundation and others have provided about the law, it seems like what United is doing is blatantly illegal and really shitty, since they would be paid extra from the assistance and from me eventually paying my deductible once the assistance runs out or I have other healthcare costs. Has anyone had experience fighting this or finding a workaround? I would highly appreciate any info or advice anyone has in order to avoid UHC’s greed and abuse of a system that’s supposed to save patients money!

679,Rinvoq,Medication Advice/Insight?,"Just got diagnosed yesterday and my gastroenterologist has offered me time to consider/research which of the following four medications I’d like to start trying:
- Methotrexate 
-Imuran
-Entyvio
-Rinvoq

Does anyone here have experience with these medications and any advice to offer of which may be an ideal choice?

Not sure what info may all be helpful to include. I am a 32 year old female. No kids and don’t want kids (she mentioned some aren’t able to be used during pregnancy). Symptoms are pretty mild as far as things go, had bloody stools about a year ago now but not since then. Now just some bloating, stomach pain sometimes and some occasional diarrhoea — which is honestly pretty par for the course for the last number of years so nothing too intense/unusual.

687,Rinvoq,Immunizations (Covid Vaccine) Advice?,"Hello everyone! I am a very new member of this subreddit; I am a 19 year old and was diagnosed with Crohn's approximately two weeks ago. I'm on winter break for the next few weeks, and my life has been a whirlwind of appointments, labs, and medications (a high dose of Prednisone that tapers for nine weeks and an antibiotic for six) all at once and I'm pretty overwhelmed.

Yesterday, I had a Gastroenterology appointment and I will have another with a Gastro specialist and a surgeon in a few days. Because I'm ideally going back to school in a few weeks, I'm going to be treated with a prescription for Rinvoq, which is, obviously, an immunosuppressant. Because of that, my doctors suggested I get the PCV 20, Shingrix, influenza, and Covid vaccine.

If you're wondering why I haven't had the Covid vaccine yet, it's because both of my parents got it and had really bad experiences with it and regretted getting it to the point where they didn't want my siblings and I to get it out of caution. I've had Covid at least once before, so I have some antibodies, but it was a long time ago and obviously there are new strains. They aren't going to stop me from getting it, but they are very wary because of their own experiences.

Any advice is welcome, I just want no bs, no conspiracy theories, or ridicule, just genuine experiences (recommendations, warnings, regrets, cautions) with getting any/all of these vaccines in the context for going back to a relatively large college in a few weeks and being on these medications.

688,Rinvoq,Liver lesion (caused by biologics?),"Hey everyone! i was diagnosed in 2020 when i was 16 my crohn’s was mild until 2 years ago it started getting worse and i went back on prednisone and started biologics for the first time (Remsima a remicade biosimilar) 

i started Remsima in february 2023 and it was like magic! my condition started improving immediately and i went into remission. even though my symptoms were gone in May of this year i had the first allergic reaction to it. i couldn’t breathe and my throat closed up, they immediately injected antihistamines and prednisone then continued my infusion with no problems. 2 months later when it was time for my next infusion they premeditated with antihistamines and prednisone and despite that i had an allergic reaction almost immediately after starting the infusion. 

My doctor then decided to stop Remsima and do a colonoscopy. he saw that my crohn’s was very active so he prescribed prednisone and decided to give me Rinvoq (upadasitinib) so i started a 45 mg dose on August 8th and so far everything is good i’m not experiencing any symptoms except being tired and some weight gain. 

In october my doctor ordered an abdominal CT for checkup purposes but we discovered a lesion on my liver (i did an MRI may 2023 and it wasn’t there) 

Then i did a new MRI with contrast and the mass/lesion was still seen it’s 4x4 cm (pseudolesion as the report says). My doctor saw it fit to take a biopsy to make sure it’s benign, but the radiologist couldn’t see it on the ultrasound. then i went to 2 other radiologists and they also didn’t see it on the ultrasound (both colored and normal)

i don’t know what to do and i’m living in constant fear of what this might be. I’m not sure what caused it but i’ve read about “drug-induced liver lesions” and suspect that might be it. has anyone here had similar experiences?",2024-12-29 13:35:20,CrohnsDisease,5,1how4l0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1how4l0/liver_lesion_caused_by_biologics/,2024-12-29
691,Rinvoq,Anyone have experience with Crohn's possibly messing with antidepressant effectiveness?,"So I've had Crohn's for 10+ years now, and I am very fortunate that my particular case has been manageable. However, I also deal with major depression and some other things, one medicine I take is Wellbutrin XL, and I've began noticing the pill in my stool like at 2pm. So I was like that isn't good because it's supposed to last the majority of the day and if I'm 💩ing it out at 2pm, it sure isn't getting the chance to do its job.

So I talked to my GI doctor, and she did some lab work, most of the markers look fine which points to my main medicine (Rinvoq) doing a good job at keeping the Crohn's at bay. I have a scope coming up in January so that will give her a more complete picture. In the meantime, they gave me Bentyl which kind of slows down the intestinal track and ""calms"" it down.

Now I see the pill in my stool still closer to like 8pm ish which is good. I've read it is normal to see a ""ghost pill"", basically the shell of the antidepressant. However, I put on some gloves, plucked it out and crushed it, and all of the powder (the ACTUAL ANTIDEPRESSANT) is still there.

So ya, I looped in my mental health doctor into this too, and he isn't really sure what to do as I'm sure this isn't a problem he deals with a ton. So after the scope in January maybe that will help use figure out what to do next because from my perspective the antidepressant isn't doing anything if it isn't even partially dissolved. Some people have said with certain meds (Wellbutrin being one of them) the generic manufacturer matters, and sometimes its better to pay for the brand name if possible. Right now, money is very tight for me, so I'm just doing the best I can.

Sorry for the novel but just kinda aggravated now that I know I've been taking essentially a sugar pill antidepressant for a while now lol... I'm not in a full-blown flare up, but I did get laid off in November so no doubt the stress is aggravating the Crohn's and other stuff. **Anyone else have any experience with this or any thing I might try?

695,Rinvoq,Anyone else experience this on Rinvoq?,"I’ve been on Rinvoq for 8 weeks now, still on the 45mg loading dose. It started working for me within like 2 days! But now for the past ~10 days, I’ve noticed some Crohn’s symptoms starting again. I’ve had less of an appetite and definitely some abdominal pain. When I was flaring, my stoma would bleed a lot, and it’s been much better and that symptom hasn’t returned. 

In August, my calprotectin was in the 500s. CRP in the 30s. A few days before starting Rinvoq, calprotectin was 1100 and CRP was 68. A month after starting Rinvoq (early November), CRP was down to 8.5 (the lowest it’s been in years, yay!!!). But a week ago (end of November), my calprotectin was in the 700s.

Has anyone else had back and forth on symptoms during the loading dose? I’m not sure if my calprotectin is trending right because it’s lower than it was right before starting Rinvoq, or if it’s not trending right because it’s still high? 

Also not sure if it’s alarming that I’m suddenly starting to get pain when it had completely gone away or if I should ignore that until the loading dose is done and then see how I do?

700,Rinvoq,Weight loss issues  and TPN,"Hi, I’m 36 and have had crohn’s since I was 13. At 30 I was put on Entyvio and TPN for bad flare and extreme weight loss and malnourishment. I had only been on the TPN for a few months while the Entyvio started to work as well as being put on antibiotics for SIBO. Entyvio put me in pretty good remission for maybe two years and at good weight. But It never helped with my frequent diarrhea. Then I very slowly dropped weight over a few years period with up and down symptoms of crohn’s that eventually got me to the hospital in a really bad flare a very malnourished again. Put on TPN again and change to Rinvoq. It started to work wonders, I had consistent solid poos again and my insides were feeling much better in matter of a week or so. Due to a likely reaction from the rinvoq we decided i couldn’t take it. So after stopping my diarrhea came back but my stomach still felt decently well for a little while. I have been mild to moderate symptoms since then. Started skirizi in July. still feel about the same. I’m still on TPN, and I eat pretty well, but I still can’t maintain my own weight. It’s like my body isn’t absorbing anywhere near what i am taking in. I can’t imagine being on TPN forever. Just curious if anyone has any similar experience with the inability to maintain weight and need TPN. My experience with rinvoq leads me to believe that I just haven’t found the right med.

706,Rinvoq,Started RINVOQ and feel like I was lied to about fertility,"Prefacing this with this is NOT meant to be an anti-RINVOQ post/I don’t want to scare anyone off of it! It is promising and I’m so glad to see that it works for a lot of people. It just sucks being an almost guinea pig. Sorry if this is all over the place, was worrying about it all last night and just need to vent this morning!

I’ve started RINVOQ this week and although I’m already feeling a bit better, I’m feeling really frustrated and like I can’t trust my GI team.

Basically, I’m 31F and I was a little apprehensive to start RINVOQ mainly because it’s not supposed to be taken while pregnant according to their site (husband and I are hoping to have a child in ~2 years as long as Crohn’s is under control), and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little meh with seeing the posts about invasive aspergillosis (also on 30mg of pred at the moment). I spoke with my IBD nurse about the fertility aspect and she told me it was completely fine during pregnancy and that the main thing is to get the flare under control first. I took what she said at face-value, but I wish I pushed more. I’m baffled as it seems everyone is else is being met with much more caution around it and being warned not to get pregnant while on it, going back on it in the second trimester, etc. Maybe lied to isn’t the right word, maybe it’s more like I feel the team just wants to get my flare under control and are less concerned about how it affects the future, and it doesn’t feel like they have the full picture.

I also noticed that my menstrual cycle is drastically reduced, whereas previously I’ve always had heavy and regular periods. Of course looking it up, this doesn’t seem to be a unique experience…the joys of being a woman and there being limited studies on how it affects us I guess.

To be clear, it’s not exactly that I regret taking RINVOQ (if it gets me out of this flare I’ll be so happy), but I’m a little jaded. I’m worried that once we’re ready to start TTC, I’ll need to be taken off RINVOQ and put on something else, and then what if RINVOQ fails in the future? I’ll definitely reshare my concerns with the GI team, I just wish they took my concerns more seriously instead of brushing it off.",2024-10-25 07:23:08,CrohnsDisease,9,1gbomak,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1gbomak/started_rinvoq_and_feel_like_i_was_lied_to_about/,2024-10-25

2,Humira,Why is Prednisone not as effective this time as previously?,"**I have only been on Predinsone 4 or 5 times before for relatively short periods.... so I highly doubt this is a tolerance issue.**

Anyways, I recently experienced mild flare up symptoms, got a colonoscopy done, and it showed mild inflammation.

I was debating whether to take Prednisone, because it was only a mild inflammation which felt somewhat manageable with diet.  But I begin Entyvio infusions on December 4th (previously on Humira which stopped working).... so I felt I needed something to keep me afloat till then, so I decided to start Prednisone 4 weeks ago.

30mg was effective, but since 25mg I have had to be mindful of my diet and was still experiencing occasional urgency and pains. Now I'm down to 10mg and the flare is quite easily triggered through certain foods.

I'm confused, because I had worse inflammation in the past whereby Prednisone contained it completely and I could basically eat anything.

Supposedly this is only a 'mild inflammation' yet it seems my gut is sometimes more sensitive than previous times when the inflammation was worse. Don't get me wrong Pred definitely still did a decent job overall this time - at least from 15mg above - but for some reason not as holistically as previous times.

Any theories as to why this may be?",2025-11-22 13:56:06,CrohnsDisease,4,1p3ttz4,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1p3ttz4/why_is_prednisone_not_as_effective_this_time_as/,2025-11-22
4,Humira,Just gave myself my first hadlima shots,"About 2 and a half years ago I tried Humira and I thought I had a bad reaction to it so I stopped taking it. Starting about 4 months ago while on no meds for Crohn's other than Zofran, I started having the same symptoms that I thought was a reaction to Humira, so I thought I would give it another go (my insurance didn't approve me for Humira again, so I got off brand hadlima). I have severe cptsd from a whole host of traumas, but mostly my many stints in the hospital since childhood and all the horrendous things I've been through related to health so after two weeks of the shots sitting in my fridge, I finally pulled the trigger and gave me my first four. The two in the tummy hurt way more than the two in my thighs; in two weeks I have to give myself 2 more shots and then every two weeks after that, only 1 so I think I'll stick for my thighs. Let's hope this works! After years of neglecting my health since I just didn't want to deal with it, I'm finally so tired of living this life that I'm trying to get everything back in order. Hopefully my body isn't past the point of no return because Crohns is far from my only problem, but it's the major one and the one that has been running my life since I was a toddler (31 now).

8,Humira,Dual therapy - Adalimumab and Methotrexate (for newbies or youngsters),"This is a question for those newly diagnosed with Crohn's (in the last year), as the preferred treatment paths seem to change year to year... and doctor to doctor.

Case in point:  My child was diagnosed with Crohn's several months ago, and put on adalimumab (humira).  Initial blood levels look like they are trending in the right direction, though she hasn't been checked for drug levels (it's been 7 weeks.) Next appt is supposed to be in February.

We go for a second opinion, (as one does for a complicated lifelong condition with multiple treatment options- we let her doc know ahead of time), and the second doctor said that a dual therapy of Adalimumab and Methotrexate is the newest and preferred path of treatment.  The Methotrexate is only for the first 6 months. He seemed very adamant that this is the newest and most effective treatment path.  Additionally, he suggested we get her levels checked for the drug she's currently on.  We circle back with our doctor, shared this recommendation, and we were simply told that our doctor doesn't recommend this path.  No reasons, just that statement.  (And that we could make an appointment to discuss it further-- except we can't, because his first available is in March, which is at the 6 month mark, when she'd be stopping the dual therapy.)  He also reluctantly agreed to get her blood levels checked for the medication-- after we asked for it.   We are pushing for more information obviously.  

For the record, while we were there, the 2nd opinion doctor conferred with another doctor, who said she also is not currently using this dual therapy (for those newly starting on biologics.)

  
So, has anyone (or anyone's child) been on this dual therapy?  Has anyone been on the mono-therapy (just the adalimumab, as my child is), with perfectly fine results, or with less than fine results?  It's so hard to choose a best path forward when the doctors themselves are in disagreement over what that is!",2025-11-06 22:28:23,CrohnsDisease,1,1oqd245,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oqd245/dual_therapy_adalimumab_and_methotrexate_for/,2025-11-06

I was put on Humira which helped to start, but I eventually failed that. I was put on Rinvoq which helped until I started tapering from the loading dose to the maintenance dose. I'm now on a Remicade biosimilar along with Mercaptopurine. I have psoriasis due to the tnf-alpha inhibitors... and ever since two recent fistulotomies I am in a flare. Again. 

This week I've erupted into Erythema Nodosum-land again. I'm in between providers. I can't heal right from my recent surgery. I'm almost certain I'm failing this new biologic. I really just want my guts/rectum cut out so I can have a better quality of life. But maybe that's emotional? Just frustrated by doctors raising their eyebrows and telling me I'm a complicated case. I don't fault them. Just feel hopeless sometimes.

Have any of you failed many meds but somehow had a decent quality of life? It feels like there's just no medical treatment that will work for me. It's tough to not feel like I'm maybe missing out on the best of my kids' young years by needing to manage all of this nonsense. 

I try to do all the ""right"" things-- monitor my gut microbiome by way of eating healthfully and choosing decent supplements ($$$). These things just don't seem to work long-term and I don't understand it.

Can one have Crohn's and not simply be suffering all the time?

14,Humira,Humira to Skyrizi - side effects,"Hello!! Little background on me:
30 yo female
Took Humira for 9 years. Gave me my life back! It stopped my sense of urgency but still had many complications… Currently dealing with a very small gastrovaginal fistula and perianal Crohn’s disease symptoms. 
Most recently, I was hospitalized with sepsis in May which is what led to the decision to make the move to Skyrizi. I am really hoping this is what can put me in remission. 

I had my first infusion 3 days ago. Went fine but when I got home, fell asleep and have been sleeping 12-14 hours per day ever since!! Also an on and off mild-moderate headaches. I see many of you mention fatigue - how long did this last for you? I am trying to chug water in hopes it calms my headache, has anyone had any luck with getting their symptoms to calm down? 
Only Humira side effect I had was my skin would sunburn easily…oh and getting sick constantly. 😭😂",2025-09-25 22:30:02,CrohnsDisease,1,1nqko1j,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nqko1j/humira_to_skyrizi_side_effects/,2025-09-25
15,Humira,Autoimmunity is so complicated and frustrating,"Hello! I am wondering if folks here have any stories of being on biologics for other things and having trouble pinning down diagnosis or having break through flares or failing biologics after years of efficacy. My situation seems complex and tricky.   
  
History: 

Lifelong chronic diarrhea accompanied by severe cramping. Gallbladder removal at 18 y/o after many painful attacks + gall stones. Lifelong psoriasis as well, but very mild. Hidradenitis Suppuritiva started during teenage years, although I didn't know what it was and didn't go to the doctor for it for years. I grew up very poor and we didn't go to the doctor much. Went to college and started having horrible stiffness and joint pain. After getting diagnosed with HS, and Psoriatic Arthritis, I was prescribed Humira at age 21 with the primary target being HS. We hoped it would also help Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. Around the same time, I get a colonoscopy for the chronic diarrhea and stomach pains and it is inconclusive. Despite doing the prep, I wasn't empty. I was told that some non-specific IBS/IBD situation was likely but it was hard to tell with the inconclusive colonoscopy, and we hoped Humira would help. 

Humira completely cleared my HS, helped PsA and Psoriasis but never ""fully"" treated either. I'd wager about 50-60% effective for those. Looking back, I think it may have helped my digestion somewhat? I fell off of going to my GI doctor while finishing school and eventually losing insurance for awhile during Covid when I had to drop out. I know that I still suffered from stomach pains and diarrhea regularly, but I think not as often. It's honestly hard to tell at this point because believe it or not it's hard to remember things from even 5 years ago. I didn't push with GI because I was already used to diarrhea being a part of my life and I was young and stupid, as bad as that sounds. 

Fast forward to grad school. One day I wake up constipated, and it never stops. I spend at least 12 months with horrific constipation. I'm getting hemmorhoids left and right. Straining. Having to go in with a glove and coconut oilt o manually remove frequently. It's like my bowels stopped moving. I go back to Gi. They tell me to up fiber and drink miralax. I up my fiber a lot through a plant heavy diet. This makes my constipation somehow even worse. I am in hell. 

I finish grad school. I'm still stressed af because I can't find a full-time job. In March of this year I am about 18 months or so into my newly chronic constipation with no relief, and then I start having a whole cluster of symptoms that seem to be some kind of autoimmune freak out. I get a ""rash"" all over my upper body; face, trunk, armpits, etc. There are no welts or hives, but it itches like a hell I have never experienced. I can't sleep through the night and when I am half asleep I am digging at my skin so much I wake up with broken blood vessels all over. No amount of anti-hisamines help the itch. I had no exposure to allergens and no known allergies to cause the reaction. No known food allergies. I say rash lightly because it was actually like the middle layers of my skin swelled up and were very red and hot. I get a prednisone shot in the ass and that makes the swelling go down. The deep itching that feels like its my literal nerves on fire persists for 4 weeks before resolving slowly. Doctor has no idea what caused it. 

Around the same time, I develop dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, stop sweating. About a month later, I'm in the ER for a kidney stone. (Never had any kidney problems before. Drink tons of water always.) I also develop extremely painful ulcers all over my tongue that won't go away. Eating is hell. I lose my appetite which is something I have never experienced in my life. Always been starving 24/7. I lose about 30 lbs over the next 6 months or so. Over the course of 6 months. The ""rash"" comes back 2 more times, each time a couple months apart. The subsequent occurrences cover less surface area, but still just as itchy deep in my nerves. More prednisone. My tongue never gets better. When one ulcer heals, another pops up. I am also fatigued, exhausted, body is in pain all the time all over. 

I undergo so so so much bloodwork between endo, PCP &amp; rheumatology. Looking for possible sjogrens or maybe Lupus. Looking for antibodies for those, as well as connective tissue diseases, thyroid panel, and ANA. 

All bloodwork is normal aside from low positive ANA. This means essentially nothing because it is known I have autoimmune diseases and that is so non-specific. All other antibodies are negative. No signs of high inflammation markers. 

Given everything, by rheumatologist's best guess is a drug-induced lupus/sjogrens profile which is possible with Humira, even after several years. She asks me to stop Humira. 4 months off Humira, dry eyes and dry mouth improves, some fatigue improves but not much because now I'm untreated for the original diagnoses. My constipation continues. Stomach pains from hell. I'm shitting blood all the time which I think is coming from right inside my rectum. My mouth ulcers do not let up. I see a GI doctor again and I don't like her at all. She doesn't spend much time with me so I say forget her and I start looking for word of mouth of a more qualified and competent GI in my area. I am still waiting for my upcoming appointment with this person who sounds promising. ENT is treating mouth ulcers with magic mouthwash but it doesn't help the root cause, which is still unknown. 

My history with digestive trouble, the random kidney stone, switch from lifelong diarrhea to severe constipation, and mouth ulcers has me wondering if they might end up landing on Crohn's, or UC. I have no idea if either of these can explain the rash, or what symptoms are related vs not related at this point. This autoimmune shit is so impossible to make heads or tails of sometimes. If I do have Crohn's or UC, then theoretically Humira should have been helping it, right? I question if it was helping it all along and I just didn't realize it until shit ended up hitting the fan, and that was possibly me ""failing"" Humira as people often do with these drugs. 

I don't want another colonoscopy because I feel certain there's no way in hell I'm going to be able to empty for them to find what they need to see. I am unsure of what else they can do to investigate or what to ask for when I see this new Gi doctor to see if she is equipped to deal with the complexity of my situation. If I do end up with a Crohns or UC diagnosis, I don't know where we will go from here with biologics because trying to treat both HS and IBD are often conflicting. If Humira stopped working, is another biologic going to do anything?

It looks as though humira has less overall side effects ? I’m really not a fan of injections so was leaning to the other option based on it being a tablet. However one side effects from methotrexate was sickness, I suffered quite bad with it. But this was only once a week. Where as upadacitinib is per day so would imagine the change of this side effect is much higher.

18,Humira,Question about medications,"Crohns diagnosed for 18 years. Initially failed Infliximab then on Azathioprine and Humira for a few years before stopping due to remission. After flare up last year tried Amgevita but didn’t work and GI moved me onto Ustekinumab (Stelera). During my loading dose I took a reaction ( lightheaded, unsteady on feet, chest pains and pressure in head ). They stopped the infusion and symptoms went away the next day. GI now wants me to try Upadacitinib (Rinvoq). From what I’ve read JAK inhibitors are a last resort after biologics and reactions to Stelera are fairly common. 

I wonder if anyone has any advice or been in a similar situation? Should I be asking about trying other biologics first before moving to JAK?

19,Humira,Average timescales for biologics maintaining remission,"I am 27F and have had Crohn’s for 15 years. I had an emergency resection within hours of arriving at hospital after being ill with Crohn’s symptoms for several years.

I was fine for 10 years afterwards and maintained remission on azothioprine/imuran. Three years ago, my inflammation returned and the meds began affecting my liver. It was time for biologics and my first time on pred.  The first biologic I tried was humira - this was fine for a couple of months, until I developed antibodies. This rules out all anti-tbf. I moved to stelara, which took a long time to work. I could not taper from 30mg of pred for 8 months. I then had to have my stelara injections increased from every 12 weeks to 8 weeks. 

Recently, I have begun experiencing some flare symptoms: joint pain, urgency, eye issues, headaches, nausea, tummy pain at the lower midline and the centre of my abdominal area. It’s not looking good.

I am so worried that I might need pred or worse that my medication has failed. It seems that for most of us, we spent a year finding a. Suitable treatment only for it to stop working in 2-3 years later, going right back to the start and loosing everything we have built in the good times.  

I don’t want to burn through biologics as there aren’t many different classes. I am concerned that my only option will be a stoma or meds which are unsafe during pregnancy. This condition really puts me in a state of apathy and kills my motivation.

22,Humira,IBD,"Ok so I got diagnosed with chrons about a year ago and ever since I started on humira I’ve been super consitpated but not only have I’ve been constipated but also I’ve been hearing people say that I smell like shit a lot, and yes I wipe correctly, I even use baby wipes. Recently I figured out a way to stop the smell which was to use the bathroom before going anywhere and use a bidet so I won’t leave a smell. But usually when I’m in public like school for example I always get nervous poops and whenever I need to poop there’s always a smell that starts leaking out even though the poop isn’t even ready to come out yet. It’s very annoying and embarrassing and I’m literally known as the girl who smells like shit at school. If anyone has any tips/help plssss let me know.

Also I talked with my doctor about getting my medicine changed but she said it’s a very high risk of the other medicine not working and if I get back on humira my body might reject it.

23,Humira,Any luck changing biologics for symptom improvement?,"Hi all. I'm currently on a humira biosimilar. My GI says I am in remission (for about a year now) but none of my symptoms have improved and many have worsened (cramping, stomach pain, fatigue etc). His basis for this diagnosis is a colonoscopy where he saw reduced inflammation after use of the biologic. As such he says any symptoms I have are not Crohn's disease, but maybe i have IBS as well or another autoimmune disease (i also have extreme exhaustion and joint pain that is not Arthritis related.)

I've spent the last year seeing doctors and getting tested with no further diagnoses. Interestingly another specialist (non-GI), a family doctor, and an IBD nurse have all suggested looking at a different biologic. So just curious: has anyone who has changed from a working biologic (after it stopped working in most cases I assume) seen noticeable improvements with a different drug? I'm frankly not sure that my GI has the right of it at this point.

24,Humira,Humira failing ? (+ tired of this disease),"Hi,
Been on Humira for 7 weeks which I know is not a lot to come to conclusion BUT let me explain. 

Week 1-2 was ok. Symptoms were mostly gone and I stopped budesonide. In week 3 symptoms came back a lil stronger but after the 4th injection on week 4 symptoms were gone for 2 weeks. 

So in week 6 I thought I’d be okay after my injection but the days after, symptoms came back worst than before. I think I’ve never felt this bad. Went to the toilet 10 times the morning with quite a lot of blood in my stools. I’ve never seen so much since I’ve been diagnosed. Mucus too. 

I can’t understand how I could have almost 0 symptoms for 2 weeks and suddenly I feel like I’m with no treatment even though it’s supposed to get better the more injection you have ? Almost a year since I’ve been diagnosed and 2 years of symptoms (if not more). I’m tired of the ups and downs. 

Do you think I’m failing this biologic or is this a normal response ? Cause honestly I don’t want to have such symptoms anymore; it’s ruining my life. I’m seing my gastroenterologist in 1 week and half. My tests (calprotectin + CRP) are always normal, so we can’t really rely on them. But my gastroenterologist told me that there are a few people with Crohn’s where inflammation is not visible through these markers… I guess that’s me.",2025-09-04 11:38:00,CrohnsDisease,1,1n87qdf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n87qdf/humira_failing_tired_of_this_disease/,2025-09-04

Hi everyone!

It’s been 6 weeks since I stopped budesonide (after 6 months) and started Humira (biosimilar). Since then I’ve been dealing with weird insomnia. I only sleep 4–5 hours and then I’m wide awake, even though I still feel exhausted. It’s like sleep isn’t really helping.

Could this be some kind of budesonide withdrawal messing with my cortisol, even after all this time? Or maybe something else? Has anyone experienced something similar?

27,Humira,Transitioning from Humira to Skyrizi …… reminding me how much Crohns sucks.,"I was very lucky to have a good long (7+ yr) run with Humira. Unfortunately, around Christmas I started flaring with terrible dumping syndrome. Horrible name but medically accurate. Fast forward to my scope in April  and my Dr said it was the worst scan she had seen of mine in 8 years.  

I fortunately haven’t had any guttate psoriasis flares but after stopping the Humira and starting the Skyrizi I am painfully reminded how miserable this is. I have my first OBI on Sunday and hoping that I will soon love it as much as I love my Humira which made me forget I had crohns most of the time. 

I am assuming this is normal so my apologies for the pity party. Just posting in solidarity incase anyone else is suffering through this.

29,Humira,Doctor discharged me without having a new doctor,"Hi everyone so I’ve been diagnosed with perianal crohns, dealing with fistulas for about 4 years now. 

Me and my ‘old’ GI doctor always seemed to have gotten along however it just seemed like aside from medicine there is no cure for fistulas. 

Started out on humira, then begged him to switch to Inflectra at every 8 week infusions, then to 6 weeks. About 2 months ago I had a really bag flair which resulted in a new fistula forming and it sent me into a panic. 

I asked for a certain type of antibiotic ‘Bactrim’ as I did some research and it showed it’s for skin irritation, boils things like that.. he wouldn’t give it to me and basically told me if I didn’t take what he gave me that I would have to go to the ER or my family doctor. Both answered made me so upset for obvious reasons. That’s when I said I would like a referral to another doctor. This conversation took place via his assistants. 

I am on the waitlist to see a new doctor, however the lists are very long and come to find out I’m discharged from his patient list but will still ‘monitor my health in the meantime’. I’m sorry but as I’m going for infusions every 5 weeks; I don’t feel comfortable with a physician who decided to discharge me without a personal conversation- to monitor my health. 

Apart of me wants to stop biologics until I do get a new doctor but I know that could be bad. But how do I feel comfortable with being monitored through someone who literally took me off of his list without any conversation between him and I. It all just feels like the biggest slap in the face. 

And today I’m going to see a CRS who I’ve seen a few times in the past. And I guess I will look to her for some advice about how to proceed. But I’m very disappointed that I’m so deep in all this now with being on medication and now my GI doctor that I’ve been dealing with for 4 years turned his back just like *THAT*.

I am feeling worse than I remember ever feeling. I don’t have constant pain - but I have insomnia, fatigue, 2-3+ loose BMs per day, and nausea. My body skipped my cycle this month. I am struggling to find anything besides bread and fish that doesn’t make me violently ill. 

Does anyone have any advice? I know some people need 6 months to feel better on the Skyrizi but I have a gut feeling it’s just not working for me. Is it crazy stupid to quit and try something else. 

For context: I was diagnosed over 15 years ago and most successful on Humira for 7+ years. Had a surgery. Stopped medication for 5 years. My doctor suggested Skyrizi or Tremfya when my most recent Colonoscopy showed moderate Crohn’s inflammation and ulceration. 32 (F) in NY Metro Area

31,Humira,Flare after infliximab infusion,"I had an infliximab infusion a couple of weeks ago (I’ve been doing them since earlier this year) when I noticed I started to flare the day after. Infliximab has always been helpful prior to this and my latest labs showed that I had little to no antibodies to the medication as well as a good amount in my system. This was a couple of months ago though. I also take azathioprine every day. I would say before my infusion things were more on the normal side with some softer stools a little less than half of the time, but nothing like diarrhea (very rarely diarrhea btw). Over the last two weeks, it’s progressed to be a lot more like number 7 on the Bristol stool chart, half the time it’s a 6. I’m only going like 2 times a day, but I think there was a day I went 5 times. I have some other symptoms of a flare like cramping and mouth sores, fissure pain and bleeding (though mild at the moment). 

I did message my GI, and I see her soon, but I wanted to know if anybody else has experienced some kind of flare right after their infusion (or other administration of whatever treatment you’re on). I’ll be really upset if it stopped working for me. I was last on humira and that stopped working for me after some months of it too. I also have ankylosing spondylitis and I feel like my SI joints have been more inflamed since then too :(

I know it’s not super severe right now, but it’s concerning nonetheless. I hate this disease.

33,Humira,"New GI insists on Crohn’s misdiagnosis + I’m in remission, what labs (if any) should I ask for?","Hi! Sorry, this is going to be a long one. I’m 26F and was diagnosed in 2017. I took Humira for two years, reached remission, then contracted Mono and was advised to stop all medications in 2019 until I got over the symptoms of Mono. My old GI monitored me every 3 months until Covid and I basically haven’t had a GI since then. It’s 2025 and I’d like to find a GI because I don’t want to leave my health up to chance but I feel like I’m having a lot of trouble finding someone because I don’t have active disease. 

2022/2023, I went to see my Primary and she suggested it’s time to see a new GI. I took her recommendation and made an appointment with someone her office referred me to. We had a virtual consult and within 30 seconds of the call, the GI told me that he had taken a look at my records and confidently said I had been misdiagnosed. He said based on the records he reviewed I had no indications of Crohn’s in 2017- specifically he told me that there was no evidence of chronic inflammation and he hypothesized that I had probably just had an infection that went away on its own. He said that *no one* is able to stay in remission without medication so the fact that I’m not on any biologics or anything else proves that it was a misdiagnosis. He didn’t suggest doing any labs and I kinda felt like I hit a brick wall with this GI, so I did nothing. 

I did call my old GI and asked if a misdiagnosis was possible and she told me she had done a biopsy of the inflammation present at my initial colonoscopy and the inflammation she saw sufficient for a diagnosis (in conjunction with all of my other symptoms). 

I haven’t been back to my primary ever since (I did try to actually to be fair- tmi, but I had a pilonidal cyst and some other chronic pain in my joints/groin and had to see other practitioners bc it was just too hard to schedule with my primary) but I have my yearly physical next week and I filled with so much dread!!!! LOL I feel so shut down based on my last appointment and I’m really starting to really wonder, what if it truly was a misdiagnosis? I don’t see a lot of people saying they have been in remission for x number of years without medication (outside of the people that swear by a lifestyle, diet, yoga change to “cure” yourself) and I feel really confused.

Does anyone want to give me feedback on: 
(1) How likely do you opine a misdiagnosis is based on the limited info I described above? Has anyone experienced something similar?
(2) If I ask my primary to make a new referral to see a GI, but I don’t have symptoms or reason to believe I am not in remission atm, what should I even ask of a new future hypothetical GI? Thoughts and prayers? Labs every 6 months? A colonoscopy at 30 instead of 40? I have no idea. I will ofc ask my Primary for advice but any suggestions for a place to start would be great.

34,Humira,I need some advice please!!!,"Hello everyone I’ll try and be as short as possible. I’ve had Crohn’s disease since I’ve been 18 years old and I am now 38. I have been on many medication’s including humira and Stelara which I stopped in 2019. I stopped because they gave me awful side affects and none of the medications have ever worked…Throughout that time I have had multiple surgeries counting four in total and after 2019 I went completely natural and had some really good success with it. (Atleast for a little while)

I am very weary of medications especially biologics. For the past year or so my Crohn’s has been getting worse and my recent calprotectin test came back at almost 600!! 

My gastroenterologist wants me to get on a biologic asap and I told him I a scared of the cancer risks associated with biologics. Now I know if you leave Crohn’s disease unchecked for a long time you have a higher risk of getting cancer than maybe the meds have a possibility of causing.

He said since I am concerned about the cancer risks he gave me a choice of either Entyvio…Skyrizi or Tremfya. He said those three have no cancer associated risks??…I’m not sure how much I believe that. But I am considering Entyvio because I’ve heard good things about it. Can anyone tell me if they’ve had any success with any of those? Any advice or any information at all? Good or bad. Thank you!!",2025-07-29 00:14:56,CrohnsDisease,4,1mbwwix,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mbwwix/i_need_some_advice_please/,2025-07-29
36,Humira,Severe Crohn’s disease,"In June 2018 my mother passed away from stage 4 SCLC. She had suffered with severe crohns disease her whole life and had gained the cancer as a symptom of a medication. 
In May of 2024 I was diagnosed with moderate crohns disease. I was 17 and would be 18 in the winter. On my 18th birthday I got my first stomach infection and it has been down hill from there. I have had 2 stomach infections, multiple flare ups, and been hospitalized twice, one of those being for a blockage. After my last MRI I was informed that in the span of a year my Crohns had formed more scar tissue due to the chronic inflammation that Humira wouldn’t bring down. I am now labeled as Severe and switched to Remicade.
My life has changed forever. But you know what? I still kicked ass. I graduated High-school top 15 of my class, 93 gpa for four years. I missed a collective of 2 months my junior and senior year due to undiagnosed and then diagnosed crohns but that didn’t stop me. I’m now going to be in college in 3 weeks, I’m looking for a remote job so that I can work with my disability, I continue to try to make my life better. 
I adjust where I need to and try to take my challenges head on. When they told me I needed an ng tube for my blockage I did freak out I’ll admit. But after a minute of tears and prayers that I will be ok, the nurse asked if I was ready. “As I’ll ever be, let’s do it.” 
These things probably aren’t a big deal to most of y’all but I am proud of myself from how far I’ve come. This disease has caused so much depression and anxiety, especially with my family history. But I’m making it work. Life is shit but I’ve grown to appreciate the life I have.

37,Humira,Taking Humira potentially way too early?,"I take Humira weekly - used to be biweekly until it stopped managing my symptoms fully. I take it on Sundays, but I forgot to refill my script on time so I didn't get it until this past Wednesday. I took it that Wednesday, and I just took it again tonight (Sunday) to be back on schedule. So there were only 4 days between doses instead of the usual week. 
Is this, like, unsafe? Should I have just skipped the extra dose until the next Sunday? I don't plan on making a habit of this but want to know in case I'm in a scenario like this again.

38,Humira,A warning about pyoderma,"This is largely a warning about pyoderma gangrenosum, but also a bit of a horror story. This is in the UK under the NHS.

I've been a complicated crohn's case most of my life, eventually losing my colon entirely. I've been on assorted immunosuppressive therapies, mostly humira. Thankfully since the loss of my colon I've had no further gastro symptoms.

In that operation, my ileostomy was moved to the opposite side (wasn't expecting that!). Around this new wound I developed a nasty skin condition, pyoderma, that disintegrated my skin and oozed horribly.

Stoma nurse didn't have any advice, so I went to the dermatologists. They gave me increasingly strong topical steroids until it was under control - it never healed, and it'll fall apart if I stop using them, but it was under control. This proceeded for about six years - I was only able to get maybe one appointment a year from the derma team.

Throughout 2023 my usually chronically low blood pressure exploded - but, I wasn't monitoring it - had no reason to - and had no symptoms. Start of 2024 I was alerted to this by damage to my eyes. They effectively put me on BP meds without further investigation and sent me on my way.

Then in April I was throwing up without clear cause. I took myself to hospital only to be informed by kidneys were completely destroyed. No cause could ever be identified, biopsy showed they were almost entirely damaged scar tissue with zero chance of recovery. I've been on dialysis since.

29 at the time with a generally healthy diet and Caucasian, the more typical routes to kidney failure are infinitely unlikely in my case. A few things were tested - oxalates, HUS, some particular rare blood disorder - nothing turned up.

Later I'd realise that my GP had many blood test results for me throughout 2023, including kidney function, and these tests do clearly spell out my rapid decline in kidney function. My GP made no effort to \*tell\* me this - I got some automated-looking texts about making an appointment, but given my GP's website """"closes"""" in the early hours of the morning, without any context I never had the impetus to wake up early and request one.

Only recently did I encounter studies detailing a strong link between pyoderma and kidney failure, e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33890227/.  I had never previously imagined these had been related, having believed the pyoderma was 'just' a skin condition.

My hesitant understanding is that my autoimmune damage shifted, possibly in response to the immunosuppressives, from my guts to that area of my body. As I say I've had zero small bowel symptoms for many years now. While the skin damage was unpleasant but liveable, I think there are high odds the same cause was behind my rapid kidney failure.

I don't think I can do anything about this in terms of compensation. That theory is impossible to prove after the fact, and it's impossible to prove it could have been averted even if the dermatologists hadn't been obviously neglectful in their handling of an autoimmune symptom closely linked to organ damage. I'm still going to look around. The distribution is a struggle, I feel like I've been failed by SO many different parties here, but that makes building a case difficult.

You get the idea - if you ever encounter pyoderma, raise a massive stink until it's properly sorted, please. Dialysis is no fun at all. Even if I get a transplant, at this age it won't last and I'll need another. There's also every chance that the same damage that destroyed my current kidneys would destroy a transplant until this is properly dealt with. Dialysis takes upwards of 20 hours a week and leaves me exhausted beyond belief. I work, dialyse, sleep, work - there's no time left for anything else. I've never come closer to giving up than this. It's not something you want to take a chance on.",2025-07-20 00:17:15,CrohnsDisease,28,1m4b7x1,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m4b7x1/a_warning_about_pyoderma/,2025-07-20
39,Humira,Small Bowel Intussusception?- As an adult with Chron’s,"I got diagnosed with Chron’s in 2019 at 21yo. I was on Pentasa for about 6 years &amp; it stopped working. Started taking Humira in Fall of 2024 after colonoscopy showed inflammation again. I was under the assumption my Chron’s was under control, but for the last 2 nights I was up basically all night with horrible upper abdominal pain. Finally went to the ER today. After several tests ruling out other things, they did a CT scan and I was told I have a Small Bowel Intussusception. 

I was eventually discharged because I am still able to eat/drink and I am not showing a blockage. They did tell me to come back to the ER if that severe pain comes back or if I show any new symptoms. From what I’m told if it comes back I’ll need Surgery. Has anyone else dealt with Intussusception as an adult?? Did you have surgery/how did it go? Not a lot of info online since this is mostly seen in young children and babies🥲

40,Humira,Prednisone moon face,"Update on 9/2: moon face went away within a week of stopping pred. It didn’t appear until over a month in, and I was midway through the taper. I’m doing a lot better and they put me on weekly Humira. My wedding is in a few weeks!!!

Just started prednisone for my latest flare(calpro &gt;6000 which I’ve never seen and I’m freaked out by) (was on budesonide but was not seeing any improvement after 6 days so doc switched me). 

My wedding is in less than 3 months and I’m worried about physical side effects of pred especially moon face! I’m on 40mg for two week, 30 mg for two week etc taper.

Before this my crohns barely affected me toilet wise and was pretty much in control. i’ve been flaring since october and got admitted to hospital for 3 months in and out. I had to change medications as the biologic stopped working (stelara). i’ve been on prednisone, infliximab twice, humira, azathioprine, stelara, rinvoq and now currently on skyrizi they said this is kind of last choice of med so im kinda stuck what to do as i got put on steroids for 3 months then this new one skyrizi which felt like it helped until about 8 week mark where ive had another flare and has not stopped. It’s now gotten worse im going to toilet about 13 times a day and i have to run, there’s no blood however which is a good sign but anything i eat i have to go. I just hate to tell my nurse as there solution is always just steriods. My 12 week appointment is in august to review how well skyrizi is working.

42,Humira,A doctor told me that my illness wasn’t that bad,"Today I had an appointment at a surgeon for something that doesn’t concern my illness. He is really competent but he couldn’t help saying small comments that were somewhat dismissive. While I didn’t pay attention to the majority of these, I couldn’t help but feel disrespected.

At some point, I had to tell him what meds I take, I take Ritalin for ADHD and humira for IBD. We discussed about IBD, he asks questions to know on how I manage it. The symptoms were always there ( they even get worse) from childhood but I only got diagnosed 2 years ago. It’s not unmanageable but I still have some difficulties that led me to therapy and I am quite secretive on how it affects me. 

So when he asked me details, I willingly didn’t explain the extent of my chronic illness : I just gave generic answers when I could. When he asked me when did I start to take my treatment and that I replied a couple months ago, he told me "" You don’t have a severe case of IBD then"". I didn’t know how to reply and tried to joke about it, I said something like ""and I’m grateful for that!"" 

But deep inside it felt invalidating. I struggled to get diagnosed, it ruins my work life, I stopped having a social too. My crisis are unpredictable but the pain is so intense that I pass out. The chronic fatigue, both mentally and physically is difficult to manage. 

I do have some great days and, objectively speaking, I do not have a severe case of IBD. I have a mild one. But this comment felt like he was saying that it’s minor. He did look like he knew a lot about it and that he encountered many big cases. But still, it also triggered some deep issues that I don’t feel comfortable sharing yet. 

I just wanted to know if I was legitimate to feel hurt and that his comment was insensitive ? or if I was in fact overreacting. The latter might be true but I just don’t trust myself on what to make of it.

44,Humira,Anything Helps,"I was just diagnosed with Crohn’s in November of 2024. I went the first 21 years of my life without any significant health issues or signs of bad gut health. I then go on a one week vacation to Mexico, and come back with the worst digestive problems of my entire life. I didn’t have control over when I had to use the bathroom. At any moment, my stomach would drop and I’d know I had about 20 seconds before I was going to have an accident. I stopped sleeping through the night, waking up 2-3 times to use the bathroom. I thought it was travelers diarrhea and that it would go away with time. 3 months later and I’m still having the same issues so I go to the doctor about it. He recommended an antibiotic for what he also believed to be lingering travelers diarrhea. That didn’t work. I was then put on prednisone to manage the inflammation. After several more months of tests they finally had an idea of what was happening to me, Crohn’s. Once that was determined, my Gi put me on Humira. That didn’t work. So now I’m taking Rinvoq and it has definitely helped my symptoms but I’m still struggling. I haven’t had a “solid” stool in over a year and a half and I haven’t slept through the night for the same span of time. Do these things get better? It really doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, as it all comes out the same. Another thing I noticed while glancing at this subreddit was that people often talk about experiencing pain. I will say that’s the one thing that I can’t relate to. If I had to rate the pain level I’ve been at I’d say it’s probably been a 3 or a 4. Is this normal? I’m just so tired of stressing out over this, even though I know it’s going to be a constant stress in my life. I don’t know what’s happening to me.

I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 10 years ago and I failed a few treatments until now (Mesalazine, Humira, Entyvio, Stellara). I’ve been on Infliximab with azathioprine for 6 months and that showed great results for me. After the 6 months, the doctor and I decided to stop azathioprine and continued only on Infliximab every 8 weeks.

And suddenly, I started to have symptoms and my calprotectin levels are high again, with no infection and normal CRP. I talked with my doctor about having more frequent infusions, at 6 weeks.

I’m on antibiotics and cannot take Rinvoq while on them. Once the antibiotics are up my doctor wants me to try Rinvoq again but if it doesn’t work he wants to try Skyrizi. 

So I’ve been on biologics in the past. Remicade (built up antibodies), Humira (stopped working), and Entivyo (stopped working). I was wondering if anyone has had great results with Skyrizi and if it hurts like Humira did. I was on Humira when they still had the stuff in it that made it feel like someone was injecting fire into my stomach. So I’m nervous about injections.

52,Humira,I think I’m actually out of options and I don’t know what’s left.,"I’ve been diagnosed for more than 15 years. 
In that time I’ve been on every medication and never been in remission. 
Humira- had a reaction to
Remicade- Didn’t work enough, developed a stricture, went back on it years later and had severe reactions
Stelara- never worked enough, developed a stricture and stopped it after several years
Skyrizi- Had a bad reaction to
Entyvio- lost any effectiveness after a couple years
Cimzia- Am deathly allergic to a base ingredient
Rinvoq and Xeljanz- Debilitating side effects, and somehow made my Crohn’s worse (I took them for another condition, at less than the Crohn’s dose)
Tremfya- Currently 9 weeks into, and things are only getting worse by the day. 
Also currently additionally on a TNF blocker that’s not approved for Crohn’s but showed promise in some cases (not enough for approval)

I don’t remember all of the older non biologic meds but I’ve been on all of them- pentasa, methotrexate, 6mp, Imuran, even things like Prograf (I was on a combo of methotrexate, Prograf, and Stelara at one point- still had a active disease)

I’m not allowed to take steroids again due to damage it caused to my adrenal system. 

My disease is everywhere, it’s usually just in small intestine but lately has spread to my colon and stomach too, so it’s not like the diseased area can just be chopped out.

I have other conditions that make me very unlikely to qualify for clinical trials. 

I see my doctor in a few weeks, but we were both really hoping the Tremfya would kick in, because we knew my options were basically gone. ",2025-06-15 05:18:30,CrohnsDisease,13,1lbsjvm,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lbsjvm/i_think_im_actually_out_of_options_and_i_dont/,2025-06-15

I’m 38F and was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2003, presented primarily with perianal fistulas and fissures at the time. I failed aza and mtx and have been on Remicade for about 20 years 😱 it was a miracle drug for me.

Hoping to get thoughts/opinions from those who were on Remicade for years and then switched to something else. 

I am DONE with the circus of prior auths and related billing issues that don’t seem to stop no matter what I do…resulting in mis-processed claims and bills for several thousand dollars for my infusions, that take months/years to resolve and no one at the infusion center or doctors office or insurance company seems to care nor know enough to be able to help me. This is all despite copay assistance from the drug company.

The resulting stress has gotten so bad it has ironically caused me to start having symptoms I haven’t had in years…with abdominal pain and worsening fatigue. I just can’t take it anymore so I’ve reached out to my doctor. I’m nervous to switch to something else because remicade has worked for me for so long… I know there’s so many new drugs that weren’t around in 2003. Should I try Humira?

I took Remicade for many years, but when it stopped being effective, they put me on Humira. Humira was fantastic, but when my insurance coverage changed a couple years ago, Humira wasn't in the formulary. They switched me to Hadlima.  Hadlima works.

My new insurance, which will start August 1st, does not have hadlima in the formulary. Humira is in the formulary.  We were just told all of this yesterday afternoon.  I think there's a couple other biologics that are adalimumab. 

 Our only choice for health insurance is take it or leave it. There is one plan available.

How interchangeable are the different  adalimumab medications?

Can I go back to Humira?   At least until they change our insurance coverage in another two years...

2 weeks ago I started to have this tingling pain in the right side where the stomach meets the ribs. I felt it was a bit of a pinching when breathing.

The pain got worse and worse to the point where I went to the ER in the hospital. I started feeling pain when inhaling and exhaling, burping, passing gas, coughing, sneezing, etc. I would also feel pain in my chest when lying on my sides.

In the hospital, did they did all sorts of blood tests (including crp), ecg (heart), chest xray, ultrasound, urine tests - and everything came back normal.

Currently, the pain has gotten a bit less, but it really hurts to sneeze (I force myself to stop sneezing because the pain is so strong. While resting I feel nothing but if I purposely take deep breaths I can feel pain.

Anyhow, I was supposed to start Steqeyma in January. I did not. We had bought a new fridge and a bag of 2 doses of Stelara had been forgotten in the mini fridge. So I have actually had 2 doses of Steqeyma as of today. I had skipped a dose due to a terrible cold that was triggering my asthma.

About 6 weeks ago I started getting a rash on my neck. It went away. Then a rash and hives on my forearm. I woke up with scratches all over my arm. Apparently I attacked the itch in my sleep. This too went away. Finally I started getting a rash and hives in my cleavage and the itchiness is insane! I recieved a phone call from my pharmacy asking how the medication was going. I said I guess fine except I have a rash. End of conversation. I googled Steqeyma and the side effects and saw rash was one. Soooo, I went to see my dermatologist today. He says stop steqeyma, contact you g.i. and go back on Stelara. 

I emailed my g.i. and his team is saying I would have you pay out of pocket to go back on Stelara.

62,Humira,Anyone else in ER level Pain but not Hospital level pain?,"I’ve had Crohn’s for 13 years now, it took around 18 months for me to find the correct medications to finally put me in remission. I had a solid 9-10 year run where my meds were working and I was feeling great on Humira. 
Eventually my body built up antibodies against Humira and it stopped working. Since this development I have been in and out of the Hospital with extended stays or Multiple ER visits bc of the pain. 
I’m finally on Skyrizi and it seems to work but my insurance is fighting me to be on it and I had a lapse of 5 months without it. Which led to more ER visits and much more pain than usual. 
I feel like I’m in a weird state where I’m in pain all the time but when I go to the hospital I know I won’t get admitted bc they can’t do anything and I feel crazy for asking for pain meds (for relief). Not sure what to do about the situation I’m in. I have a 8/10 level pain and need relief but I know if I go to the ER it will be zofran, Pain meds, CT, Fluids and then get sent home and I feel crazy for even going.

64,Humira,Rinvoq increase,"Ok long story short I went from humira to rinvoq last April. Worked amazing total remission but the 15mg maintenance dose just wasn’t cutting it. Basically teetered on the edge of a flare for a bit. Wound up super sick with the flu this march, had a lapse of getting my meds from some insurance bs and was off them for about 2.5 wks. Cue full on flare. I had labs and ct scan nothing major just some inflammation at my resection site. Upped dose to 30mg. after about a wk I noticed I felt tremendously better. Saturday I even told my parents I think I’m totally fine now crisis averted. I had two drinks Saturday….I swear to god I think it just reversed everything. Alcohol doesn’t typically make me flare but maybe since I was just in the early phase of getting back to normal? Idk I spent all day yesterday in bed today almost called out of work the pain in my upper middle gut is so bad it’s that wave of intense pain that builds to a peak and stops. This impacts my life so much I’m a single mom of two boys so the guilt/depression that comes with wks of flaring is just too much.

66,Humira,How Can I Fix my Injection Anxiety?,"I recently started Humira (about 4 months ago), and I think the medicine is working. I was never shown how to give myself the injection. My doctor just told me to watch a YouTube video and do it myself. I really wish that I could get a clear answer on the exact steps, but different nurses keep giving me different answers, and my doctor isn’t responding to any calls. 

I thought I figured out how to give the injection to myself after screwing it up the first time. I disinfect my skin, pinch the injection site (rotating which site I use each time), and push down the pen at a 90 degree angle. I wait for a click, and a green indicator fills my pen when the injection is finished. I usually don’t retract the pen until 10 seconds after the indicator just to be safe. 

I didn’t have any issues after that first time, so I thought I knew how to do it. However, I’ve had liquid on my skin the last two times, even though I’ve done everything exactly like I did the every other time. I know a drop or two is normal, but this is more than a drop. 

I called the manufacturer about a replacement the first time because I thought it might have been defective, but they said that defective pens are extremely rare and that they would give me more information at a later date. It has been two weeks since that without a response, so I gave myself my next injection today because I figured it was too late. I got scared that this injection would go wrong, too, and there was liquid again. I’m beginning to worry about this and giving myself injections. Also, this is a month without medicine now, so I’m probably going to flare, and I can’t stop wondering what I’m doing wrong to screw up the injections. 

I also tried calling to see about a nurse showing me how to do it the right way, but my doctor isn’t responding to calls or messages on the portal right now, and I don’t have an appointment for another five months. Does anyone know how I could get another nurse to show me this in person?

68,Humira,When is the time to switch biologics?,"For context, I am a 31-year-old male who was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at the age of 25. I have been on Humira, Entivyo, Stelara, Remicade, Rinvoq, and Cimzia in that order. I have had success with Humira, Entivyo, Remicade, and Cimzia.

I started on the Cimzia, in August 2024. The first two weeks all of my symptoms went away, and for the first time in eight months I was able to come off prednisone. I then started to flare again in early September and thought the medication wasn’t working, had to go back on the prednisone again, but after doing a very slow taper, by Thanksgiving, I was off of the prednisone again, and the Cimzia seem to be working well. Over the course of the next five months I remained steroid free. I did have days where i started hurting again, but they would go away, and I would feel good again. The Cimzia for the most part kept all symptoms at bay. Was it perfect? No, but I had MAJORITY good days, and NO steroids. 

Well, I started hurting in early April, except it never went away. I know it’s inflammation, because it feels a certain way. I tried to wait it out, but the inflammation started to spread to my knuckles, my kneecaps, basically anything with a joint. I then requested prednisone from my Doctor Who wrote me a 30 day supply/taper. I tried to taper off of them, but when I stopped taking them all these symptoms came back within a day. I hate to admit it, but I think the Cimzia has run its course.

I was trying to give it more time to see if it would start working again, we even added 6MP back to the mix, but I’m still not seeing a response.

Should I give the Cimzia a little more time to pick back up? Or is it time to move on, to the other options that I have such as Skyrizi, Omvoh, or Tremfya.

73,Humira,No one seems to care. Doctors suck. Any options/ideas to speed up the process to receiving my medication?,"I did great on Humira for several years, but apparently it suddenly stopped working. I now have ulcers and inflammation in my small bowel and am actively losing blood.

This should have been discovered months ago, but due to carelessness and whatever else, it has dragged on for too long. I learned I was anemic in November, but my CRP/ESR were normal. My GI’s response? Let’s wait and see. Then in January it got worse. Colonoscopy in May last year was good, so let’s do an EGD. I ask him to do a double balloon EGD so that he can get the full picture. Does he do it? No. Just a regular EGD and then he wants to do a capsule endoscopy. It takes three weeks before I’m even able to do the capsule endoscopy and then of course the active disease was found. So now I’m waiting in the third week of waiting to be able to get Skyrizi. No pressure, no urgency from anyone and my anemia just gets worse. Insurance is taking their sweet time and also claiming they haven’t received any prior authorizations while my GI’s office claims it was sent. So here I am unable to process the situation and who tf I’m supposed to go to to get things finally moving.

At the same time, I’m trying to get iron infusions to keep me from completely crashing but the hematologist office is also being unhelpful and making me wait for days to be able to get another infusion that will likely be just enough to maintain my current hemoglobin level as i continue to lose blood.

And im just pissed off because none of this would have been going on for months on end if my GI had the simple thought of doing a calprotectin test (btw I’ve never even had one done in my life, seems like CRP/ESR is all he knows). And if he did the right type of endoscopy, I wouldn’t have had to spend another month and a half waiting for a diagnosis. Likewise, why tf is it so difficult to get an iron infusion when you are desperately in need of one?

Of course, a year ago when I was in good health I had amazing insurance that would have definitely made this process smoother. But now when making the decision to go back to grad school and having to rely on government assistance, my health starts to fail and no one seems to give a fuck. I made the decision to start BPC-157 as it’s the one option that I know works, while waiting for the US healthcare system to finally help me out. I literally feel like fainting when I try to go to the gym, which is something that is extremely important to me.

Sorry, but I needed to rant.
Any advice on what I can do?

74,Humira,How does switching meds go for you guys? Do you choose?,"I could really use your guys’ advice and opinions, please.

Do you help decide what medication you’re treated with next?
My treatment has been consistent on my dr choosing the next thing, and me, just going with it.

I was put on Humira at the start of my diagnosis (sept.2023) and was on that until June of 2024 when I then got switched to Skyrizi. Had very little improvement from the Humira and my scope looked the same if not worse as when it was done for my diagnosis. 

There really was no “picking a med” myself. He suggested we start Skyrizi (there was a sister med he said we could do instead, but that Skyrizi was newer and better approved.. whatever that means) and I just went with what he said because honestly I have no idea what to do at all and I know so little about how this all works. I’m basically still a kid (I’m 19 and struggling to do this on my own), just trying to figure out how to be an adult and honestly my GI feels pretty impossible to talk to sometimes but it’s really not convenient for me to switch rn and I’m already under his care, he works well with my insurance and especially now, I can’t risk losing that. 
(Fuck our healthcare system)

Just now, April 2025 we are stopping the Skyrizi (did an MRE and shit looks terrible still, no better than sept.2023) and he wants me now to start Rinvoq.
The extent of our conversation was:

“What’s making you decide to try rinvoq?” -me

“You have failed 2 biologics already, so we want to try something that’s different” -GI

“What makes this one different?” -me

“It’s not a biologic, it inhibits JAK proteins instead of TNF/IL blah blah blah” -GI

“Alright” (well what else am I supposed to say?)

So I start rinvoq as soon as insurance approves it and hope that this one works.. I guess.",2025-04-09 18:59:51,CrohnsDisease,7,1jvdrp2,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jvdrp2/how_does_switching_meds_go_for_you_guys_do_you/,2025-04-09

76,Humira,Is it time for Biologic?,"Hey all,

TLDR: Since January I have been in a flare. CalPro  was close to 700, ultrasound showed some inflammation in ascending colon. Budesonide didn’t work but prednisone seems to be. Feeling almost back to my normal after two weeks at 40mg, now on 30mg to taper.

Despite all this, docs keep pushing for biologic. I know, steroids are not long term solution. If it’s truly time, I’m open. It’s hard for me to justify though because I have such a mild case so far (no Crohn’s related surgeries) and a round of steroids has worked in the past to keep my inflammation down long term. 

Background:
As the titles says, I’m for the first time seriously considering starting a biologic (probably Humira). I have had Crohns since birth, diagnosed at 2. Was treated with mesalamine, 6mp, and a few rounds of prednisone as a kid (im now 29).

Long, long story short, as my meds didn’t feel like they were helping and after insurance crap, I stopped everything 10 years ago and have almost been exclusively using CBD. I know it is not an approved treatment, which is why also I get scopes and other tests yearly with GI. Every one has been relatively clear, showing little to no signs of inflammation.

Only treatment I have in last decade is one round of Budesonide after CalPro came back 600 a few years ago. Steroids brought it down to 17 and it has stayed below 50 since.

GI doc has even said in the past (when I wasn’t flaring) that this may be the best my crohns could function. It could be possible to start a biologic and see no huge marked improvements, but obviously that point no longer stands if my day to day becomes higher levels of inflammation.

77,Humira,Biologics - Can you stop/start them?,"(21m/London)

Hi all,

I have ‘mild’ Crohn’s disease. I have previously taken a 3 month course of Budesonide. I was meant to start adalumibab however my GI suggested against it as I haven’t (currently) got a significant day-to-day symptoms. I’m currently unmedicated.

He previously stated I could do a course of biologics, I don’t know the time frame and then stop and see how I am without any medications.

From my understanding once you start biologics they are something you are meant to stay on for life?

For instance if you take humira (adalumibab) for let’s say 5 years. You can’t take a 10 year break and then start Skyrizi? 

Would it have to be one after the other right away?

Thank you.

Best wishes.

31 yo female here, I  have severe fistulizing crohns, diagnosed almost 11 years ago. First biologic I was on was Humira, which worked really well for about three years, then it stopped working and I developed fistulas (they’re gone, but I now have fecal incontinence) The next one they tried was Remicade, had a severe allergic reaction to it, so that was a no go. Next it was Stelara, which did sort of calm my guts, but made the fistulas worse as I couldn’t fight off infections. Fast forward two years, had the fistulas treated in India, but that flared my crohns pretty badly, so Ive been on prednisone for a couple months, which is keeping me from bleeding, but I still have way too many bowel movements, can’t gain weight and daily life is pretty hard. My insurance finally approved Entivyo, after making me wait over a month. Anyone have success with this med? I’m really hoping it will be like Humira and give me at least a few years of relief.

5. Never had pain;
6. No nausea.
7. fecal calprotectin - okay

I am a possible carrier of Crohn's disease (waiting for more tests). I live in Brazil, and I see many people here using Humira/Remicade. How is access to the medication where you live? The price here is ridiculously high. To give you an idea, a worker earning the average Brazilian salary would need 5 months of work, without spending on anything else, to buy a vial of remicade.

Also, is there anything that makes that stool better?

(TL;DR) Hello everyone, I've been following Reddit for a long time, and by the twist of fate, I find myself in a situation where I am 90% likely to have Crohn's disease. In 2022, during a routine consultation, chronic nonspecific inflammation was found in my duodenum. At the time, the doctor didn't prescribe anything, just asked to repeat the test. In 2023, the result was the same. Since the doctor, again, didn’t prescribe anything and just asked for the test to be repeated after a year, just like the first time, I decided to change doctors.

In 2024, a new doctor reviewed the tests and informed me that it was nothing serious, just do the exam and, if the inflammation persisted, follow a diet and repeat it until it went away. Well, I followed the recommendation and... nothing! The doctor thought it was better to have a consultation with a GI who works exclusively with clinical cases. Since no one had ever considered anything more serious, I also ended up going along with it. With the new doctor, she suggested the possibility of Crohn’s disease and requested both an endoscopy and colonoscopy. An important detail here: I’ve never had any symptoms. No pain, no diarrhea (outside of what would be expected for someone lactose intolerant). However, after the colonoscopy and endoscopy, I’ve been facing a Bristol scale 6 and 7 situation for over 30 days. During this period, I had 3 days of consistency, but it always returned. I took two loperamide hydrochloride pills, and it stopped for 3 days, but then it came back. What’s interesting is that I traveled for 4 days and ate everything (including milk-based and sweet items), and I had no issues. The bigger problem here is that I did an occult blood test on my stool, and it came back positive. So, researching and with the help of ChatGPT (don’t judge me), I am now considering a 50% possibility of Crohn's disease. I have two young children, ages 5 and 2, and I live in Brazil. I have anxiety and can’t stop thinking that I will die young and won’t be able to raise my children or guide them on the right path, and that thought haunts me every day. From what I’ve seen, the treatment here is basically 5-amino salicylic acid or 5-ASA (which is horrible for me because I am hypertensive, and my creatinine levels are at the limit, 1 to 1.20, with the normal limit here being 1.20).",2025-03-24 19:07:34,CrohnsDisease,1,1jiyxrd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jiyxrd/need_tips_tricks_and_talk/,2025-03-24

When I was first diagnosed my doctor put me on remicade which seemed to really help get the inflammation under control however I was having some pretty severe side effects and opted to get a new doctor who put me on humira. 


The side effects of humira were wayyyy worse (hard to breathe, really bad chest and back pains to the point I thought I was having heart attacks every week) so I got off all medicines completely and opted for medical marijuana and diet changes as my way to control this disease. 


It has been about a year now with no medicine and I recently stopped smoking weed, and since I stopped smoking I have noticed the diarrhea and abdominal pain have come back, almost the same as when I was first diagnosed. 


I am also going through heightened stress right now partly due to this and also because of things going on at work.

Part of my stress is because I know when you get off biologics the chances of them working when you start them again is very low. Has anyone been in a similar situation and have any guidance?

84,Humira,"Well... finally got my infusion... just to have it go very wrong. Farewell Inflectra, I hardly knew thee. (I guess this is why the epipen and benadryl are so important).","Follow up from my Monday panic post, the infusion clinic was able to get a nurse out yesterday to administer my dose. Which I believe would have been my 5th (maybe 6th?) inflectra infusion.  Never had any issues or reactions to it before; aside from as of late, based on recurring symptoms, it did not seem to be working. 

Anyways, about maybe 5 or 10 minutes in; I started getting this really uncomfortable warm flush feeling. If you've ever had IV contrast before, it was similar to that very brief feeling you get as they start to push the contrast... except in this case, it didn't go away, it just kept getting worse.   
  
I hesitated at first, thinking maybe it was just temporary and would pass... but... then my abdomen starting hurting, my head started feeling really heavy, my heart feeling like it was going to jump out of my chest, then felt an itchy feeling in my throat followed by difficulty breathing. I got the nurses attention, who quickly stopped the infusion, and gave the epi, followed shortly by IV benadryl; then a bag of plain saline after to help flush. Best initial guess is that I must have developed antibodies to it (which certainly didn't take long), so my body went into attack mode on it. 

Still feeling really miserable today; everything hurts, my joints all feel stiff and achy, super tired and feel like my brain is in a fog. Heard it can take a couple days to feel normal again, so guess it's to be expected. 

Two biologics down (failed Humira prior), on to the next :(

Rinvoq never did anything for me either. I was faced with surgery a year ago, as the only other option I had at was Skyrizzi. I was on 50 mg of prednisone per day, for about eight months, and I really did not want to have surgery, but I knew that I could not stay on steroids forever and a last ditch effort, we decided to try Cimzia, because I have had success with other TNF agents in the past. This medication which I have been taking for almost a year now, has worked so good, that I have been off, steroids the entire time, I have been off of 6MP the entire time,  I take no medication besides the Cimzia. Now it’s not 100%, every now and then I will eat something and have a bad day, but on my last CT scan, they saw no active signs of inflammation, and the stricture that was once picked up on a CT scan at my terminal ileum, is no longer visible, massive improvement!

My doctor seems to think that it has something to do with Cimzia being pegylated, which most other Biologics are not. Either way, has anyone had this kind of success on this drug? My doctor is baffled. He thought it was going to be a waste of time trying a different TNF agent, and it has proved to be the best Crohn’s medication I have taken yet. I went from getting ready for surgery a year ago, and steroid dependent, to no surgery needed, no steroids, and no 6MP!

I’m sorry if this question is obvious, I just feel like there’s no end in sight. I was told three years ago that I should expect remission is 5-15 years, but it seems so for away.

90,Humira,Silent Chrons Disease,"Hey everyone! I’ve been reading this chat for about a year now. I have always doubted I had chrons disease. On May 2023 I had two anal skin tags and in June an abscess formed. I went to my school’s doctor (university) and they couldn’t figure out what it was for months. I finally saw a colorectal surgeon on December 2023? I had a surgery appointment for March of 2024. A few weeks before my surgery, I had another anal fistula. 

By this time, I started noticing anal leakage :( and I eventually got two setons placed in. In april, I had a colonoscopy and everything was fine. I was placed on humira and June? I stopped for a month? Because I never got my shipment. I switched to the generic brand and have been on it for a while. I really don’t notice much? I’ve tried changing diet nothing really helps I just realize that DAIRY causes a lot of issues but I still eat it. I stopped drinking for six months and started again recently and nothing really changes. I refused to believe that I had chrons disease until I asked chat GBT and it told me about silent chrons disease. 

I guess my symptoms are: mild stomach pain, gassy, my poo is regular no diarrhea, I don’t throw up, all my blood counts are normal everything is normal with me. I kept trying to figure out if it is something else. My two anal fistulas have no healed….. idk anymore ",2025-02-26 16:36:43,CrohnsDisease,1,1iyrq48,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1iyrq48/silent_chrons_disease/,2025-02-26
92,Humira,Stelara wearing off after 5 weeks....what do i try next? This girl is so stuck,"Hi everyone, i am looking for some support and reassurance and...hopefully someone can point me towards the right path. I have tried numerous meds after my long-term treatment became ineffective and nothing seems to stick. I am running out of options. 

I  (27 F) have had crohns since aged 10,  diagnosed aged 14 via emergency resection. For the past 2 years, i have been struggling to find a treatment that will afford me any semblance of health. After my surgery, i tried Mesalamine (Pentasa) which didn't work. I moved on to Imuran/Azothioprine and had 10 years of good health (with the occasional budensonide regime).  In this time, i graduated and began working, i lived a normal life. 

About 2 years ago, i really flared -  severe inflammation and strictures. I tried Budensonide for 4 months,  it didn't help.  My Imuran/Azothioprine was stopped as it was harming my liver. I was given prednisolone (Steroid) and Humira (anti-TNF biologic) and felt great for 3 months. My symptoms came back after as i developed antibodies to  Humira. This time, the pred didn't help, i started at 40mg taper and i would flare again if i tapered to less than 30mg. I was on pred 8 months!   I stopped pred in November,due to the mental health impact. 

I have been on Stelara since my loading dose in July. The stelara was a slow-burner, the loading dose and initial 12 weeks injections didn't help.  I now receive this every 8 weeks. It helps but my symptoms come back after 5 weeks. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I am in the U.K, the NHS isn't keen on conducting a colonoscopy if i am not losing blood (overshare since we are friends and family here xx).   I know, there are other therapies but my IBD nurse said they may be harmful in pregnancy (Skyrizi, rinvoq ect). This makes me so miserable,  i want to have a family in the next few years. 

Is there anyone else out, that's been in my situation with meds, had dreams of becoming a parent in spite of crohns, had these worries about the future? -&gt; what do i do please?

93,Humira,How do you get over the social anxiety of pooping because of your Crohn’s?,"Hi, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2022 but I’ve struggled with the urgency to go since possibly 2017. I constantly find myself in situations where I have to go #2 in public places, and it will be abrupt. I can obviously never control the timing, but it always feels so embarrassing when I’m in public and I have to drop what I’m doing because the urge to go takes over. I have my Crohn’s well maintained with humira, and I haven’t had a flare up since 2022, but I hate that I’ll be out somewhere and the urge hits and I’ll be MIA for like 10 minutes, thinking my friends definitely know I’m pooping. It does not help that I’m a woman and my friends are mostly dudes (they all know about my disease), but I always feel like I have to acknowledge the situation with something like “I can’t help it I have Crohn’s” or some other variant to acknowledge that I either have to stop to poop or just took so long to poop. It’s embarrassing and I know it’s a normal human function and it’s really not a big deal, but I was out tonight at a place that had one single stall bathroom and my friend needed to go pee immediately after I pooped in that stall and I felt like I needed to address the elephant in the room before he even had the chance to go in there and find out himself. How do people combat this and not feel like a total  weirdo if you have to bring it up, or just own up to it and move on?? The constant, self-induced, embarrassing moments feel never ending!!!

95,Humira,Remission!,"After like 6 years, 4 medicine swaps, and the worst pain ever… I’m in remission!! 

I was diagnosed at 9 years old and at some point went into remission on Remicade until I was a sophomore in high school. From that point on (I’m about to be 22), Remicade stopped working, humira, skyrizi, and entyvio, didn’t work. But like 6ish months ago I started Rinvoq and besides the acne and other side effects, I started feeling pretty good. Today I had a colonoscopy and my doc came out and said he thinks I’m in remission!!! 

With that being said, those 6 years were literal hell and I definitely saw no end in sight. But here I am now, finally gaining weight, feeling better, and doing better. 

I just thought I’d share a positive story since a few minutes ago I saw someone talk about the fear they experienced and how all the stories on here seemed like they were only about the bad.

97,Humira,I Miss Humira,"sometime in may/june of last year my doctor upped my dosage to 1/week (as necessary) and my insurance totally stopped covering it but refused to say so directly, instead saying it wasnt the ""recommended dosage"" over and over (fuck you) so i was off it for 7 Months while my doctor also somehow did nothing about it. and then in dec my insurance sent me something saying ""oh we're just straight up not covering Any humira anymore period"" with a list of biosimilars. instead of being moved to any of them (i wasnt told why, maybe built up resistance?) i was put on stelara. just had my first infusion and ive been having intense dull joint pain for 24 hours at this point (unstated possible side effect).

ive tried remicade (gave me similar side effect but burning nerve pain, unable to move, hospitalized for a week) and budesonide (gave me pancreatitis) and medication generally just doesnt work on me so when humira worked as good as it did i was so happy. also along w remicade doing that to me my mom just also had an infusion that fucked with her health severely so u can imagine i am not extremely happy or hopeful abt this

98,Humira,Lectin free diet and remission/symptom alleviation?,"Has anybody had ong term success on dr gundry’s lectin free diet?  He claims it can put crohns and reumatoid  arthritis into remission.

I have been doing it for four months and i feel moderately better, but that sometimes happens on its own….

I was in the hospital last year with a partial bowel obstruction and a hemoglobin level of 6.

I n switched doctors and started skyrizie but developed swollen bleeding gums and had to stop.  

 In the last 30 years i have been on remicaid, humira, and stelera and i wonder how many side effects they were causing without me even knowing - the fatigue? Joint pain, muscle aches, brain fog, etc?

The doctor says she sees no active disease and my symptoms are currently mild.  She said less is more right now and I was happy to take a break from biologics and see how i feel.

Reading some of the posts in this group about people off biologics for years has really scared me.  I have already had two small bowel resections, i really dont want more surgery.

But im also tired of being a guinnea pig for these new biologics.  Their long term effects are unknown and they are not tested on women at all (no medications are, it is super f**ked up)

So basically, has anyone had success lectin free for years?   Or otherwise controlled the disease without meds, but with yearly colonscopies, endoscopies, capsule caneraetc to monitor inflammation, strictures, etc, with good results?

Any advice appreciated.  I have been off meds for 4 months now

100,Humira,20 Years old with severe Crohn’s. Need help navigating this.,"Hello, 

I’m a 20 year old male with Crohn’s disease and it’s getting pretty hard to live with it. Wasn’t a fan of my last doctor so I’m now searching for a new one but I’ve been through so many now I’m not sure anymore. I could really use some advice of whatever you guys got. I’m tired. 

Little backstory I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 6th grade so around 12-13 years old. I lost a lot of weight, my growth came to a stop, I was flaring up every single day sometimes multiple times a day. I was using the restroom 10-15 times a night and about the same in the day. This lasted up until my freshman/sophomore year. I didn’t start gaining weight or my life back until my junior year. 

I’ve had 3 surgeries. One was to put an ostomy bag on me, the next was to remove my colon and the last was to remove the ostomy bag. I’ve done Remicade, Humira, Stelara, and currently on Skyrizi. I’ve yet to have a medication that really did much. 

Im extremely grateful for where I’m at right now but I’ve went through medication after medication. I still use the restroom 6-10 times a day along with 4-6 times a night. 80% of what I eat still bothers me. God forbid I have the slightest amount of grease and I’ll use the restroom 5 times in an hour. Like I said im very grateful how far I’ve come but is this really my new normal? It’s so hard so many things I enjoy. ",2025-02-08 02:50:19,CrohnsDisease,2,1ikd60x,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ikd60x/20_years_old_with_severe_crohns_need_help/,2025-02-08

I had been feeling great, so decided to stop with my infusions. That was November of 2022. I have had 0 medications for crohns since then. No steroids, no infusions, no anti inflammatory pills, nothing. I drink alcohol regularly and eat spicy food all the time.  At this point I’m not even sure I ever had Crohns. Life is normal, some days I shit more than others but for the most part it’s once a day. Did they misdiagnose me?

The hospitalization and high steroid dose has helped me get stabilized but as I have been tapering off steroid the symptoms have returned, even 3 months after starting skyrizi.

106,Humira,Considering resection,"Hi guys, so I've had Crohn's Disease since 2017. Had a 2 year flare-up initially (2 years on prednisone \~30mg), then I've got Humira after my country accepted that medicine (I live in Poland). Humira was a blessing and i had remission for almost 5 years. 

(sorry for my english)

But it was never full remission, i still couldn't drink alcohol, eat strawberries, popcorn etc, diary etc. Often I've been feeling bad etc. But more less it was good time. 

Unfortunately it stopped working and my GI decided to switch to Stelara (ustekinumab), 7 months passed on this med but I feel like it doesn't work at all. I'm not able to lower my prednisone dose, and currently 40mg is helping me living daily life but still have 5-6 times a day strong pain. 

I have around 40cm small intestine affected by disease.  I'm 25 years old. When i was 17-teen resection surgery sounded like a nightmare. Now it sounds like potential relief. What do you think? I'm considering that with my GI, but I'd like to hear some stories to get some hope. 

After the resection of small intestine the pain stopped? U really felt better? How long did it took to feel completely good? Do you regret the decision? The meds started to working better after resection?

  
Thanks in advance. I just want to live few years disease free, im tired with feeling 60% all the time.",2025-01-03 11:30:11,CrohnsDisease,6,1hskgz8,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hskgz8/considering_resection/,2025-01-03
107,Humira,Veteran crohnie looking for support ,"Hi guys,

I'm new to reddit, more or less. I have lurked around here for a while but I've finally decided to stay and introduce myself. 

I consider myself a veteran in this game, let's say. I was diagnosed at 18 (I'm 31 now), after the most gruelling process. Let's say I lived in a country with underdeveloped medical facilities, went undiagnosed until my bowel perforated, went into sepsis, then had surgery. A considerable part of my bowels was removed and I was left with an ileostomy for 2 years. After that it was reversed and I was started on a series of medication, mostly old school ones (azathioprine, mercaptopurine...) until they f***ed up my liver and was started on the experimental (back then in my country) Humira. Stayed on Humira until I developed antibodies, at that point I was on a 10 years remission. Had a baby. Got an incredibly stressful job after. New flare. After so many years, it was really intense emotionally to have to deal with this again. I'm in a country with excellent medical care now (I'm in the UK) and I'm followed by a good IBD team. I was miserable last year (December 2023 when my symptoms appeared), and I felt my life was falling apart a little. It's like I had put crohns in a corner of my brain. I knew it would have come back eventually, but I was very good at ignoring it. And then it came slapping me in the face. I'm on stelara now, after 6 months of steroids that gifted me with 10kg+ to shift and a horrible mental state (I don't do well on them). Antidepressant are doing their thing now, but I have a 3 year old, a demanding job (I'm a university lecturer) and my energy levels are always sub zero, even if I can't seem to stop sleeping when I'm off. 
I'm just down, really. I have been having the same cold since the beginning of the month, I'm nauseous, I'm tired. I want to be a good mum, a good wife, a good teacher. And I just feel like I'm not any of these things at the moment. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting here. Perhaps just a kind word from people who can understand, or a reality check in the form of someone telling me I have it much better than I ever had - I might still be in my home country, struggling to stay alive because of the sheer lack of medical facilities and doctors (it was funny when a UK doctor questioned me about my surgery, done with an ""old"" technique they don't use anymore here, and I said I had it done in my home country. She asked how it was still possible I was still alive!!). 

Anyway. I just want a hug I guess. My husband is supportive but daily life is hard on him too (he's a type 1 diabetic, has other health issues).

108,Humira,"Constipation, Gas, and Crohn's: Finding a Way to Cope! ","

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in June 2022, and the past couple of years have been a rollercoaster. I started on Humira, but it was a nightmare—I was constantly throwing up, in full flares, and completely miserable. For two years, I dealt with the full spectrum of Crohn's symptoms and felt like my body was falling apart.  

In June of this year, I switched to Stelara, and it’s been life-changing. I can eat again (mostly—there are still a few foods I avoid), I’ve regained some of the 100+ pounds I lost, and most importantly, I don’t throw up every day anymore. I also don’t have to wear adult diapers daily like I did when I was working. Back then, the accidents were unavoidable, and it was humiliating. Being a yard dog while managing Crohn’s was too much, especially as a single mom of three. I had to step away from work because it became impossible to juggle everything.  

Now, though, I’m dealing with new issues. Constipation has become a major problem—I sometimes go over a week without a bowel movement. On top of that, I have terrible gas that’s so strong it makes me gag, and if I’m in a store, I swear I can smell it from several aisles away. I know the constipation is causing the gas, and the gas itself has become painful.  

I finally convinced my gastro to prescribe medication for the constipation, and while it works, it’s a double-edged sword. The meds make me mini-flare and cause intense cramping, which is really hard to endure. At the same time, not taking the meds means dealing with painful gas and bloating, so I feel stuck.  

To make matters more complicated, my boyfriend recently moved in. He’s supportive and tells me not to worry about the gas, but I just can’t bring myself to “let it out.” I wasn’t raised that way, and it’s so ingrained in me that I physically can’t. To put it into perspective, it took almost a year with my kids’ dad—and being five months pregnant—before I finally farted in front of him.  

So, I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep taking the meds and deal with the pain they cause, or do I stop eating altogether to avoid creating gas in the first place? I know the second option isn’t sustainable, but I’m desperate to find some relief.  

What would you do in my situation? Does anyone have advice or tips for managing these kinds of symptoms? Not just for me but for anyone else in this position!! I’m open to any ideas at this point!

I have Crohn's in my small intestines and minimal in my large intestines. They keep ordering fecal calprotectin and it is always normal or slightly elevated when I flare and lactoferrin is always high because my inflammation is in the middle of my small intestines.

I am preparing for a patency pill camera tomorrow and idk if there will even be enough inflammation for them to see when I do the real pill camera to switch me to another biologic. I am so frustrated with the situation and I feel like I should not have gone off humira. My gi team said with my insurance that if I don't have enough inflammation, they can't get Entyvio covered, but they don't want to keep me off treatment for too long or I will get worse.

117,Humira,"I’m an idiot, let’s talk about it.","Long time commenter, first time poster. I’ll start with my story. 

I got super sick after a Taylor Swift concert in 2023 and thought I pulled a muscle coughing, then thought I had an ovarian cyst, then got the ol’ “the most impressive case of terminal ileitis I’ve ever seen” and with a scope that couldn’t advance through my terminal ileum, I got the Crohn’s diagnosis. After a 6 month course of Isoniazid for latent tuberculosis (thanks ER nursing), I saw significant improvement on Humira and Budesonide, and went into “remission” until BOGO berries from Publix fucked my intestines back up. Although I personally blame the Hyrimoz switch and CVS specialty pharmacy is my nemesis. 

A super dismissive GI had me desperately seeking care elsewhere and I finally ended up in the hands of a doctor I work with, who immediately put me back on steroids and sent me for labs and a CT, which showed my stricture was narrowing again and I was backing up above the stricture site. I was expecting a surgical referral. Luckily, after the most miserable Miralax prep of my life (I was up all night vomiting, Suprep should be the only prep period), he was able to get a pediatric scope through the stricture and didn’t have to dilate it. He does not recommend surgery. I started Imuran while I wait for CVS specialty pharmacy to stop being assholes and let me restart Hyrimoz (they have denied me the shots THREE TIMES y’all, I’ve been without it for 12 weeks now). 

Back to the point of the post. After the scope (which was on November 12) I finally experienced no pain for the first time since that Taylor Swift concert (and by the way, surprise, I don’t listen to her music anymore. My Spotify wrapped was without Miss Swift for the first time in a decade thanks to the diagnosis because I fully blame her for triggering it). Until Thanksgiving day, when I ate a metric shit ton of Ruth’s Chris sweet potato casserole. I fear the pecans are still shredding my intestines. RIP. 🫡

118,Humira,Massive rinvoq dilemma...,"Apologies for the long winded post, im discussing this with my GI team but would not mind seeing y'alls input into this. Annoying thing is I can't call my GI team I have to leave a  voicemail with my number and get a call back 2 days later which makes communication so annoying

I started rinvoq on June 2024 after a moderate severity flare up for a year before hand, was going 10 times a day no blood but mucus, bad urgency and tenesmus. Can't have prednisone so oral budenoside wasn't cutting it so a week of IV steroids and starting rinvoq was the plan.

Before I was on clinical remission on entyvio for 5 years. (Remicade and Humira never worked for me)

Worked in a day brought nearly all symptoms to normals. Stools weren't completely formed but that was expected since recovery would take time and was going twice a day on average. As my induction period was to end in September I was worried that I still might have some residual inflammation due to these leftover symptoms. on my rectum as even when I was on entyvio I had mild inflammation in my rectum that's been lingering which kinda led to why entyvio failed as it spread.

So this time, My GI team told me to drop to rinvoq 30mg instead of 15mg and also take budenofalk foam enemas for 1 month. This as to my expectations worked and I was going 0/1 times a day with complete trophy poops. As my budenofalk finished I stayed that way to my joy until a month later till a few days ago.

Suddenly all hell breaks loose and in the span of last week  I see quite a bit of bright red blood and mucus on my bms, awell as the bowel movements being soft+loose, thin and very discomforting during on the toilet, tenesmus and urgency was notoriously bad until my bowels are completely clear of stool. This caught me so off guard because I was going so well since rinvoq. I gained 10kg of weight mostly in muscle and im shit scared of going back to black and losing all my progress and hard work I've put in..

I called my GI team and they did blood tests on me. CRP was &gt;1, my WBCs, RBCS, platelets, etc were all normal just waiting on a calprotectin I've already sent. I was also prescribed a rescue dose of budenofalk enemas again which in the last few days have at least brought the blood down but the symptoms still remain. Im guessing that this inflammation luckily hasn't spread yet throughout the colon and is limited lower down

I know for a fact that this is inflammation because bleeding,mucus tenesmus, pain, urgency are all inflammation signs and these symptoms are exactly the same level of severity I had in last years flare. Im just confused how quickly it happened and has rinvoq stopped working for me?

(I was on doxycycline asell for a month my GP prescribed it to treat acne so my suspicions are this might have worsened it) Im guessing this stubborn rectal inflammation has made a return upon stopping the enemas and I think rinvoq for some reason like entyvio can't seem to reach down in the lower colon. Is taking enemas long term an option for maintenance or should I look towards switching?

  
p.s To add to this is upping the enema dose to twice a day an option too? Maybe for some time I can drop down to one feel like with this severity might be called for, ill check in with my GI tomorrow unfortunately communication is an issue",2024-11-28 03:22:59,CrohnsDisease,2,1h1mohi,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1h1mohi/massive_rinvoq_dilemma/,2024-11-28

I’m about 10 weeks post partum and I’ve been on Humira/Hymiroz for about 2 years now with little to no issues, confirmed remission via colonoscopy. Suddenly, two weeks ago (right after my MIL visited us 😅) I started getting what I thought was a flair - going to the bathroom 10+/day, diarrhea, exhaustion/fatigue. It continued for two weeks and I switched to a BRAT diet to minimize the number of bowel movements and dehydration. Cut out caffeine because it was causing cramps. Stopped breastfeeding (😢 which was a bummer) because it was just too much. 

Yesterday, my movements become suddenly normal. Like 1-2 times a day. Just had my first cup of caffeinated coffee and no issues. I’m not yet on prednisone and no change in my meds.

125,Humira,Unexplained symptoms and now Skyrizi issues,"No one can figure out what's wrong with me. I had increased symptoms (seeing a bit of blood in stool + had bad upper abdominal/stomach pain + vomiting bile mainly), so went to go see a GI recently just in case and they did blood work, as well as an MRI. All they found was mild inflammation in my colon (not previously seen in my last colonoscopy in January so new development there), and nothing wrong with my stomach and no adverse effects from my small bowel resection.

They started me on prednisolone, which is when I started to have occasional bouts of extreme chest pain (I'm 19, it literally feels like a heart attack sometimes, even while on omeprazole as well) and not too fun emotional reactions + crazy insomnia. Symptoms only somewhat improved, with some doing better than others on it; however, I still just don't feel too much better better. Nobody can explain the upper abdominal pain/discomfort directly after eating or activity, lack of appetite, or just generally feeling worse, as well as the spike in platelets, WBC, CRP, and ESR. I mean, what the hell is going on? I can't even get a straight answer out of all the doctors I've seen, except ""it's only mild Crohn's"" or just a simple ""I'm not sure,"" and no one can tell me why I'm still in pain or feeling sick because it's ""not serious enough.""

Additionally, I'm studying abroad right now so I am limited a bit by time with my GI here, but my GI back at home says this could be an indication that Skyrizi isn't working. I only started it in July (planning to take the next two doses for the full 6 month analysis), This is the second biologic that I have failed and only in a year, with me starting Humira in March, building antibodies quickly within 3-4 months, and being switched to Skyrizi in July. I've been told that Entyvio, Stelara, and Rinvoq will likely not be effective for my type of Crohn's, which leaves Remicade with methotrexate as my last option. Why am I even building antibodies and failing these biologics so quickly??

I'm just not feeling well right now and no one can tell me why, prednisolone helped moderately with one thing and caused a whole separate issue, and I'm scared by the biologic situation because what if I fail Remicade too and this is it?

128,Humira,Grieving over myself,"I’m having serious identity issues and don’t know how much longer I can deal with this stupid fucking disease, both mentally and physically (or rather the thought of impending physical doom in this case).

I had surgery this June, and while I failed on Humira (starting April, failed June), I seem to be doing well with my Skyrizi switch. I can eat the foods I couldn’t before, I am not in the constant pain of feeling my body deteriorate or feeling constant partial obstructions that I felt over hours every time I ate for the past 5-8 years because my parents had withheld treatment from me when I was diagnosed and it just got worse to near constant pain and fatigue. 

I am not in pain anymore and that is making me upset for some reason because now what? Now what do I do?

Recently, I felt somewhat bad again, pain in my stomach/left side (it used to be intestine, which is why I got it checked out in case there was Crohn’s somewhere else), elevated temp (no fever though), feeling faint and dizzy, stool has little hard black pebbles sometimes but not enough to be so concerned and very inconsistent quality of bowels, yellow bile vomit that has tiny streaks of red and brown and sometimes just straight grease but nothing else concerning and not having enough to be bad, and severe chest pain every time I puke (so probably bile from a lack of gallbladder).

Got it checked out in case because I just got nervous (even though pain was nothing like before with the obstructions), and everything of course came back normal, which docs are just saying I’m being dramatic or crazy.

Maybe they’re right and I’m obsessing over this little bit of pain because I’m missing being in the big kind of pain. I’m just stressing myself out to the point of being crazy over this shit, blaming every other thing other than myself for the likely psychosomatic symptoms. And if that is the case, I don’t think I like freaking out every time I get a tummy ache, I don’t think I like living like this at all, I don’t like the risks associated with having it, or the mental thought of “oh this could be severe” every time something goes wrong when I’m otherwise healthy.

Either I’m missing the constant pain I dealt with over somewhere between 5-8 years because I’ve associated my very sense of self with my pain, or I’m just still missing who I was before Crohn’s diagnosis at 9 years old and someone I don’t even remember. Either way is so awful and I don’t know who I am now. I don’t want the pain back and I can’t turn into who I was before 9 years old. I just want all this to stop.

129,Humira,Entyvio vs. Rinvoq,"Hi all!

I tried and failed Remicade and Humira. I ended up having bowel resection in 2016. I was pregnant back to back and which had put me in remission for 5 or so years. Symptoms started back up in 2023. I had been on Skyrizi since Nov. 2023. It gave me AWFUL mental side effects. Panic attacks, severe anxiety, etc. Once I stopped it all went away. I had to go to the ER for partial bowel obstructions (severe vomiting, pains, you name it).

Sept 2024 was my last dose of Skyrizi. I am currently on nothing and need to make a decision within a week. My GI offered either Entyvio or Rinvoq. Has anyone taken either or both?

130,Humira,"Switching meds due to side effects, but side effects may not have been caused by medication. ","When I first got diagnosed with Crohn's , I was put on Remicade, which was a miracle drug for me. I was on it for 15 years with no side effects and was in full remission the entire time. My antibodies were getting too high though, so I was switched to Stelara 2 years ago. Almost immediately things got extremely annoying. Within the 1st year I had 2 flare ups, and my dose had to be increased becaused my body wasnt absorbing the drug well. Things calmed down once upping the dose to max, but also once they upped the dose, the skin on my entire head (face, scalp) became extremely ashy and dry. Oddly enough not itchy, but painful skin.

So finally my doctor agreed to try a different drug and start on Humira since it's similar to Remicade. However in the time it's taken to get this set up (it took a while due to insurance shenanigans), I've realized some things may not have been caused by Stelara and I'm worried I may make things worse by switching. First off, when I had my flare up, I did a colonoscopy. It was a huge flare, but after doing a colonoscopy prep, it completely resolved within 3 days. As if it never happened. Which makes me think something must have been stuck in my digestive tract somehow, if cleansing my colon instantly solved a 3 month long flare up. Any bouts of chronic diarrhea I had went away after I stopped eating salads (i was on a health kick). Even my skin got better (not completely. Things are still dry ashy and painful, but at least I can be seen in public now). Overall not sure what's been caused by Stelara and what wasn't, and I'm worried I'm switching medications for no real reason. I have my Humira pens now and my stelara prescription has been ended, so it's too late now.

I get meds to treat whatever is going on, but I can’t seem to find anything that is proactive not reactive that has worked.

132,Humira,"Advice (Remicade, trigger foods)","Hi all,

I am currently a 23F and I was diagnosed with Crohn’s at 19. My insurance stopped covering my Humira back in April so I was switched to Remicade. I’m in nursing school and honestly it’s so hard to keep up with the infusions for me and i am constantly having to reschedule due to school and work. 
I had a bad flare up about a month ago and it ended up with me in the ED and I was put on a heavy amount of prednisone. I had a colonoscopy last Monday (due to the provider saying I needed one urgently according to my labs and scans) and it showed that everything was fine and the biopsy showed no inflammation in my terminal ileum which is great.
What I’m asking as someone who is still trying to figure this out, would it be a bad idea to change medications again to something more convenient for me? I know remicade is pretty similar to humira (not the infusion part of course) and i only started it back in early June and I didn’t know if it was too soon to switch to a different med but i also feel bad for having to reschedule multiple times. 
Also, what was something that helped you guys identify trigger foods? Did you keep a diary, app, etc? I’m still trying to figure out what all my trigger foods are as i know everyone’s can be different. I feel like I don’t have it under control unlike what my colonoscopy says I do lol.

134,Humira,Anyone here ever have an eczematous eruption?,"35M here who has been lucky enough to have Crohn's in remission for the past 11 years w/no meds. 8months ago I had a fistula appear which started the whole gastro cycle up again and was prescribed Humira. The first two months of starting Humira, I noticed my skin was itchy but no rash then eventually the itch went away. Around month 6 had an eczematous eruption (no prior history of eczema) where my entire body broke out with eczema, and within 1 month and it is EVERYWHERE. Inside my ears causing tinitus, scalp scabs causing bald spots, hands, feet, back, face, legs and so on. 

I've found some related case studies on NIH about this so I don't seem alone , though all the treatments I tried so far have been unresponsive. Prednisone was the only thing that helped drastically so far, but once that ended (10 days) I started Humira again and my body broke out even worse. I have since stopped Humira, and tried prescription steroid cream, anti histimines, topical creams, and every dandruff shampoo out there. It's seem to slow but is still very persistent.

So I'm curious, am I the only one? And if not, have you had any remedies that have helped you get over this? Figured I'd also share just in case someone else out there was struggling as well.

Sometimes during covid (guessing 2021 or 2022) I was switched by insurance to a biologogic similar. That worked okay until February of this year when I developed an abscess and fistula. I have a feeling it was due to the switch to a biologogic similar, but my GI Dr says that sometimes Humira stops working. 

Switch to today, my Dr has me on Skyrizi. I have done the 3 loading infusions and after the first 2, each time I felt a tickle in my throat and pressure in my lungs about a week after receiving the infusion.

This last infusion has the same effect but has seemed to developed into pneumonia. I am coughing up yellow phlem, have a constant cough, head stuffiness and overall malaise and not feeling well.

I should also say it hasn't began healing my fistula, slightly less drainage though. 

Has anyone else had pneumonia after skyrizi infusions? Has anyone had it help heal fistulas? So far I'm not sure all the side effects are work this crappy medicine.

137,Humira,My Crohn’s finally won,"As I type this, I do it with tears in my eyes. I have battled Crohn’s for 7 1/2 years, and have had periods of remission, and flares. I would say collectively I have had 3 1/2 years of flare and 3 1/2 years of remission. During this time, I have developed a stricture at my terminal ileum as many of you do. 2 years ago I discovered what a bowel obstruction was, and was in the hospital for only 2 days. For 2 years now, I have avoided the hospital somehow, and avoided another obstruction. I have been on prednisone on and off, Stelara failed, I had a year of success on Imuran and Remicade. Rinvoq never worked at all. Humira worked until it didn’t, same for Entivyo. 

I am currently on Cimzia with 6MP. I actually just finished the loading doses so it’s been 4 weeks. During those 4 weeks, I was able to come off the prednisone completely. I had good days and bad days, but I could tell the med was working. That changed sadly. This disease is so unpredictable, and I literally went to bed fine and woke up in a flare last Tuesday and have remained in a flare since. To say I’m defeated is an understatement. Why is my body so good at defending against these meds? Sometimes I want to say JUST CHILL TF OUT BRO!

Anyways, so now I’m back on prednisone. Yes, I still have Skyrizi as an option, but at this point why? Even if it did work, it will eventually stop, and I will need surgery. I can’t tell you how petrified I am of surgery. I had aortic valve replacement when I was 11 for a congenital defect. I have been great since that surgery, but deep down I’m still that little boy clinging to his mothers neck as they were wheeling me back to the OR, begging for her to stop them from doing the surgery because I was sure I was going to die.

I’m 30, years old now. 2 kids and a wife. I love them more than anything in this universe. I have never felt so alone. Not because my wife doesn’t support me. It’s because I’m scared to tell her that I’m scared. I’m scared to tell her that I’m afraid l’ll die during surgery and leave her a widow. I’m scared that i will leave my kids behind. Now if you ask the doctors, oh everything will be fine, we do these operations everyday! But deep down, I’m still that 11 year old boy who is scared.

I have contacted the surgeon and I’m waiting for a surgery date. As bad as I hate it, I have no choice. I don’t want another bowel obstruction. I can’t stay on prednisone forever (and btw that has always worked but even it is starting to lose its effectiveness). I want this surgery on my terms, not because I have another bowel obstruction and they have to do it unplanned, and they are shoving an NG tube down my nose.

138,Humira,Constant pooping and trying to gain weight ,"Ugh. So I’ll keep this as short as possible. You can look at my other posts if you’re curious about my story. But I’ve had severe chrons for 10 years. Been on multiple biologics that didn’t help much, aside from Humira that gave me a couple years of relief before it stopped working. I recently had to go to India to get my complex fistula treated, and that process sent me back into a flare. It’s not the worst flare I’ve had, but I’m having 8-12 BMs a day, some watery stool, and fecal incontinence. I’m currently underweight, being 5’8” and 120lbs. My primary doctor wants me to gain weight, my parents mention how skinny I am fairly often, and my husband says I’m not trying hard enough. The guilt is unbearable. I feel like I immediately shit out everything I eat. I have no idea how to gain weight if it just goes right through. Not to mention my appetite is non existent most of the time, and the anxiety around eating just makes it worse. I’m working with a naturopath, trying that route as I stated before, biologics haven’t worked well for me, and I’ve been horribly mistreated by GI specialists. I honestly feel like giving up. I try so hard but there’s no results. Keeping myself alive is absolutely exhausting and I feel like a giant burden.",2024-09-13 17:20:01,CrohnsDisease,2,1fg074y,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1fg074y/constant_pooping_and_trying_to_gain_weight/,2024-09-13
139,Humira,Anyone have difficulties with injection costs this year? I need advice. ,"I was on Humira for a few years at a cost of $5 per injection and then at the beginning of this year my insurance stopped covering Humira and my previous gastroenterologist provider so it came as a surprise when the next dose was incredibly expensive. 

I was switched to Hyrimoz because insurance said they’d cover that instead.

After several months of not getting any injections because of the logistics behind needing to wait to see a new in-network doctor to prescribe the new medication and needing to set up payment assistance via a “copay card” to pay for the injections, I was able to take Hyrimoz for 4 months until the copay card ran out.

Insurance is now saying it’ll cost me $1750 every 4 weeks as my cheapest option until it hits my high deductible of $8k, then it’ll reduce to $300 per 4 weeks.

I applied for another kind of “patient assistance” but idk if I’ll qualify because you need to be in a certain income bracket. I also got one injection dose from my previous provider but other than that have been off my meds since July.

Update: A nurse ambassador from Hyrimoz told me I don’t qualify for the above patient assistance because I’m not poor enough.

Do you guys have advice? 

I told my new gastroenterologist about it and he said he’ll try to get me into a scientific study so I can get free (but still experimental) meds.

Is this all unusual? I need some guidance.

140,Humira,weelllllppp,"Been having a pretty rough few weeks. lol

Turn's out... (nobody tested positive or anything until yesterday) The protocols are more lax on the side of the Long Term Care Facility That My wife works at. They had a big out break... and It didn't really surface there till a few days ago but it hit us about a week ago... started feeling shitty. exc. we were both down for the count her last set of days off, she works a shit ton... I have a nasty case of our lovely life partner. I wasn't diagnosed with crohn's until I was 35, but they say it's been active since I was a child. I've got the good old sever ascending stenosis, with 5 strictures and the top one has apparently been ulcerated forever but it's usually microscopic unless I flare up super bad. Technically it's like even when I'm not in a flare, the rest of my body is pissed because of the long standing damage exc. So I got hit the old vid... 

Rewind. 

One month ago I was on humira. lialda. effexor. I got the effexor filled, I had to borrow two bottles of lialda from my dad, and then cold stopped my humira. The state of California doesn't give one shit about your health, and neither does the federal government lol. They knew good and well it would grenade me without the humira, yet due to my wife having an income spike... Also due to shorthandedness at work and good money for a few months due to overtime. Not even the whole six month bracket of pay evaluation. They yanked our coverage and have just let me rot. I know this happens all the time It just pisses me off man.. They keep us in this window, where we don't quite make enough to pay for our own insurance, because I'm so god damned sick all the time I haven't been able to work for years now. 3 to be exact. We had a beautiful brand new house, I had my own business and a full time job as well.. She didn't even have to work... 2022 I got so sick I basically nearly died multiple times in a row, all to be pumped full of wrong meds by stupid doctors who wouldn't even barely make an effort to diagnose me with anything anyway. So after dealing with all that shit, at the beginning of this year we finally got on partnership, and were doing well.... 

fast forward.. over the course of the last three weeks since I missed my last shot due to the insurance being yanked. I've just been catapulting down hill... I've finally gotten things mostly figured out... and all should be well soon... 

However the last three days... I basically blacked out and went nuts, from covid, insane pain everywhere in my body that just eats a black hole in my head. No meds to combat the pain, ca doesn't believe in giving people with actual pain, pain medication anymore lol. So that's fun. Laws are cool af. 

At any rate.. I'm not dead... and my guts flared pretty bad the first week, but have chilled out a bit now. Honestly my back, my neck, my joints, every muscle in my body and and basically I'm pretty sure my whole nervous system has been on fucking fire for two straight weeks. 

Went to the Er the other night... was in a bad mental state was in shit loads of pain, couldn't think straight exc... I tried to explain all this to them... by the time a doctor actually showed up to see me... after the got done stabbing me and not finding a vein. Had to go through three techs and nine nerve shots in my arms lol... they were ridiculous... I'm not easy to get due to my health but shit... It was kind of rough... Doctor walks in and says, ""so you have a tummy ache?"" and I almost went through the roof. I didn't say a damn word about my stomach when I checked in.. I tried to start talking to him and he apparently didn't like my tone.. he literally turned around and walked out and didn't say shit other than ""I'll come back when you calm down."" Like do these fuckers get off on torturing chronically Ill people? while they sit around at their nurses station.... IN the middle of the night.... IN an empty er..... with only one other patient being seen... Just to fuck with me and leave me there for an hour plus after all that and not say a word to me lol? I just walked out... 

How much you guys think the bill will be? &gt;.&lt; Hoping to get my Humira back shortly. Seems like the covid is passing finally. 

DON'T LET THEM DROP YOU OFF YOUR BIOLOGICS IF YOU CAN HELP IT. NOT ABRUPTLY. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. IT'S A LIVING SHITFEST.

141,Humira,shrooms &amp; crohn’s?,"i am 22y female, been diagnosed since i was 15. ive had my fair share of humira, which stopped working. was switched over to stelara every 4 weeks, also stopped working earlier this year. i associate my flares with stressful times at uni, so during the summers my symptoms are usually not as prevalent. i was actually supposed to have a bowel resection 2 summers ago but chickened out because i wasn’t truly mentally prepared for it. i struggle with chronic depression and severe anxiety. i was on lexapro 15mg for nearly 4 years, and was put on wellbutrin in nov/dec of 2023. 

had a consult in may to have my surgery in august. again chickened out. in march/april i was having a really rough flare and was put on steroids for 1 week. even once school ended for the semester in may, i was still experiencing severe abdominal pain and would get full really fast. however once school ended, i stopped taking all my meds cold turkey (i know im not supposed to but oh well). i still get my stelara injections every month. 

my mental health improved greatly, but was still having a lot of my crohn’s symptoms. in july, i went back home to europe for a month. for the first time in YEARS, i was able to gain weight oddly quickly. in 3.5 weeks i put on 8lbs…WOO HOO. my weight has been a constant issue for me, and it takes a toll on my mental health and outlook on myself. my crohn’s symptoms in europe were here and there but no where near as bad as they were at the beginning of the summer. 

as soon as i got back to the US, boom…stomach pain again. my weight started fluctuating as it usually does. i wouldn’t be able to eat some days due to the pain. then one weekend i decided to take some magic shrooms with some friends. had a great time btw! but….since then, i haven’t had a single day the in which my stomach has caused me discomfort. i don’t want to jinx it but im truly in awe but also thoroughly confused! i tried reading up on some journal articles discussing the effects of psychedelics on IBD, and some say that is seems to be therapeutic for those who suffer from IBD, mainly ketamine and lsd, etc…

anyone know anything about this? personal experiences they would like to share? any advice? sorry this was very much so scattered all over the place im horrible at conveying my thoughts lol.

142,Humira,Meds are finally working,"I am on Cimzia and 6MP combo. I have taken Humira (worked until it didn’t) Entivyo (worked until it didn’t ) Stelara, (never worked and ended up with a small bowel obstruction), Remicade 6MP combo (worked for a year but then had to stop 6MP due to toxic 6MMP levels) then doc added allopurinol so that I could continue taking 6MP as allopurinol lowers 6MMP toxicity. That worked for 3 months but then suddenly it didn’t work. Rinvoq and 6MP did nothing. I took my first dose of Cimzia last week and I’m almost symptom free. The only thing (and I experienced this the entire time I was on 6MP Remicade combo) is that I feel extremely tired. Like I can’t put one foot in front of the other tired. But I push thru it doesn’t matter. I would rather feel like a zombie, than to deal with Crohn’s pain, and feeling like my insides are on fire and melting. As a matter of fact, I knew when the 6MP Remicade combo stopped working this year because the tired feeling went away, and all Crohn’s symptoms returned. My wbc is usually a 10, but on combo 6MP therapy when it’s working my wbc runs at a 4 or 5 which makes sense, if you lower wbc you lower inflammation levels. I’m just glad something is working and I can finally come off the steroids!!!!!!! I see a path forward!

I'm just on azathioprine. Used to be on Humira but after a long period of being fine without it, they stopped the Humira. 

Next set of bloods is in a month or so. I could contact the doctor earlier, but I think this is probably just part of living with the disease. Any tips you guys picked up over the years?

150,Humira,How did you know it was time to change biologics?,"I'm considering switching from Remicade to Skyrizi, but worried I might be jumping the gun or expecting too much out of my treatment regimen. After ten months on Remicade, I feel about 85% better than before, but that remaining 15% still interferes with my quality of life to the point where I hesitate to truly call myself ""in remission."" I've been doing pelvic floor therapy in the hopes that that would eke out the remaining 15% I need, but no amount of PFT seems to be able to save me from certain types of Food Regret that don't plague normal people. (Among other things.)

I've also gotten SO MANY opportunistic infections while on Remicade, which it sounds like would only get worse if I increased my dose, which is why I'm more inclined to switch drugs than to amp things up.

My gastro said that he usually starts new patients on Skyrizi, but since I'd been on Humira prior (back when I ""only"" had inflammatory arthritis, and which masked my Crohn's for a while but definitely did not put it in remission), we both decided it made sense to start me on another TNF inhibitor instead—hence the Remicade. Now I'm just wondering if I made the wrong choice and should've picked Skyrizi in the first place.

For anyone who's tried multiple biologics: When did you decide to switch? What was the final straw for you? Did you ever stop a drug that was ""good, but not good enough,"" or am I being a Goldilocks about it?",2024-08-04 16:06:30,CrohnsDisease,17,1ejyrru,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ejyrru/how_did_you_know_it_was_time_to_change_biologics/,2024-08-04
151,Humira,"My Rinvoq Experience: The Good and The Bad
","Hey everyone! I posted this on r/Rinvoq but figured I would post it here as well in case it can help anyone. 

I was diagnosed with Crohn's back in 2010 (for reference, I'm in my 20s now, so have had it most of my life). I've tried and failed many different kinds of medications including Stelara and Humira. Beyond the obvious GI symptoms, a huge struggle for me was chronic fatigue from the Crohn's. I started Rinvoq a few months ago and wanted to share my experience in case it can help someone else. For reference, I started on the loading dose of 45 mg for 3 months, and I just finished my first month on the maintenance dose of 15 mg. So I've been on it for a total of 4 months so far, and here's what I've noticed:

**The Good:**

* **Energy**: I have levels of energy that I haven't had in YEARS. I've taken both Wellbutrin and Adderall (under medical supervision ofc) to get me through the day. And that was in addition to sleeping 9+ hours and a daily nap. The fatigue was BAD, and it was running my life. In the last few months, my energy levels are normal. And it just feels so great. I don't really nap anymore, and I have enough energy to do Pilates six times a week and walk my 10k steps a day. That's on top of a full-time job and studying for the MCAT, while trying to maintain somewhat of a social life. Just gives you a picture of how much more I'm able to do when I don't have to spend most of my day in bed.
* **Bloodwork**: My inflammation markers are normal for the first time in years. Years of biologics therapy did absolutely nothing for my inflammation. I haven't yet had a colonoscopy/endoscopy/camera pill to see what's going on internally, but I can imagine just based off the bloodwork it's looking a lot better.
* **Crohn's Symptoms:** I can eat raw fruits and vegetables without discomfort for the first time in a long time. I'm not having many of the gross and uncomfortable Crohn's symptoms (don't need to go into too much detail here lol) and it feels amazing.
* **Pill Form:** It's a pill! If anyone else here has taken injections for years you know the freedom that comes with carrying your medicine in a tiny bottle instead of lugging around weekly/monthly shots everywhere you go. I love to travel so this has been HUGE for me.
* **Joint Relief:** Crohn's can come with joint pain, and I've had my fair share over the years, and I've been feeling a lot better lately.

But, as you could guess from the title, there's also been some bad.

**The Bad:**

* **Acne**: After having clear skin since age 13, I've had a pretty bad case of Jakne. It's not like normal acne, it comes in flares in big patches and can be pretty painful. I've been having it all over my face, back, chest, scalp, and in some weird places like behind my ears. I've been working with a dermatologist and this is what's helped me most after lots of experimentation (and it's still very much a work in progress).
   * ***Morning***:
      * De La Cruz 10% Sulfur Ointment spot treatment mask for 10 minutes
      * Wash face with La Roche Posay Effaclar
      * Clindamycin Gel
      * Moisturizers with SPF-I like La Roche Posay Cicaplast
   * ***After a workout/when sweaty:***
      * Spray face with Briotech Hypochlorous acid spray
      * Sometimes another sulfur mask treatment+face wash and SPF moisturizer
   * ***Nighttime-The Most Intensive:***
      * De La Cruz 10% Sulfur Ointment spot treatment mask for 10 minutes
      * Wash face with La Roche Posay Effaclar
      * Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum
      * Apply Clindamycin gel
      * Coat the corner of lips and eyes in Aquaphor (protects the skin from the tretinoin)
      * Apply a pea-sized amount of tretinoin .05%
      * Apply Vanicream moisturizer
      * Spot treat acne with Triple Paste Diaper Cream (sounds weird but works)
      * Sometimes I like to cover that all with a layer of aquaphor and sleep with a towel over my pillow.
   * ***As Needed:***
      * Lance a white-head with a diabetes lance and cover with a pimple patch.
      * Use Nizoral shampoo on face and body a couple times a week
   * ***Chest and Back:***
      * Daily 10-minute mask of Panoxyl 10% cream. I apply before the shower and let it sit while I wash my hair.
      * Differin Gel
      * Sometimes De La Cruz 10% Sulfur Ointment spot treatment mask for 10 minutes
* **Oily Hair and Skin:** My hair has always been kind of oily, but it's next level since starting Rinvoq. My skin was combo before, and now it's always oily. The skincare routine addresses the skin oily, but for my hair:
   * Daily hairwashing: I like Pantene volume and body shampoo
   * Use Nizoral shampoo as a pre-Pantene mask for a few minutes like three times a week
   * I ""conditioner-sandwich"" so my ends don't dry out from daily washing. I put conditioner on my ends before shampoo and then reapply after I wash shampoo out. I also only apply shampoo on my roots.
   * I LOVE the Tap Secret dry shampoo powder. It's incredible and super travel friendly. I sometimes apply it in the morning even on freshly washed hair to absorb oil throughout the day to prevent more hairline, scalp, and neck acne.
* **Elevated Cholesterol and Elevated Liver Enzymes:** So this may be the reason why I have to stop Rinvoq. I have elevated cholesterol and liver enzymes (more serious) which may be due to liver injury from Rinvoq. If that's the case, I'll have to stop and try something else (likely Entivyo). I feel totally fine, but it's obviously dangerous to keep going if it's destroying my liver.
* **Weight:** I've always struggled with maintaining a healthy weight and have been overweight most of my adult life despite a healthy diet and exercise. I've been told that Crohn's can slow down metabolism and Rinvoq can make it extra hard to lose weight. I may start WeGovy to help that out.

That's been my Rinvoq journey so far. I wanted to share in case this information and these tips help anyone since I so often turn to Reddit for crowd-sourcing advice.

-been having blood in stool starting in April (4 months ago) and random painful stomach pains.

-when i turned my diet to plant based my symptoms (didn’t do it for this I just wanted to eat healthier) stopped, but probably a coincidence because I am seeing there isn’t scientific proof that this actually helps.

-I am from the US and my work’s health insurance is terrible. I’ve been seeing people mention skyrizi and Humira and with my insurance those are like $1800/month :-( . I checked the humira financial assistance and I barely would NOT qualify which sucks because I live in a high cost of living area and my salary sucks.

-has anyone been on those meds and traveled longish term (over a month)? That is something I have always wanted to do, but not sure I’ll ever be able to now.

On my last colonoscopy the doctor was mad because the hospital was taking too long to up my medication and apparently my guts were the same as the very first day I came in even though at that point it's Been a year and a half of 40mg every other week.

I was taking Budesonide and noticed that I was more tired and itched everywhere. I was told by my doctor could stop taking it and well, the itchiness and fatigue didn’t go away. In the meantime I was prescribed Predisone. 

I went back on the Budesonide today because I noticed blood in my stool again. Budesonide definitely helped with that. Not sure if the fatigue was related to Budesonide or if it’s just a Crohn’s symptom. 

So right now I have both - I’d love to hear opinions on which one is better?

2. Although I do no think we will suffer the same fate (fortunately, thank god) my brother also recently went off Remicade (July 2022 approx) and switched to Inflectra. Within a year of being on he unfortunately was diagnosed with lymphoma non-Hodgkins as a result. 
Now while my brother and I have parallel biologics - I was diagnosed with Crohns about 2 years after him - I don’t believe I’ll develop any type of cancer the worry is still in my mind. Given that I will now be switching yet again from Remicade to Humira to a new drug. 
Friends of my who also have severe case of crohns are taking Stilera and Skyrizzi with what they report the worse side effects ever. 
Of course each patient is different. But given I will most likely have to switch off of Humira unfortunately I’d love to hear any recommendations for Crohns drug which has proved to be positive for the condition. Thank you!!

157,Humira,Meds stopped working...again,"Hi 

I 26F have been struggeling for the last 10 years with medication either not working or they stop working after a short amount of time.

I have tried:
Azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thiosix
Remicade (stopped working after a restart)
Humira
Entyvio
Stelara
Humira+MTX (together and one at a time)
Prednisolon (works amazing or awful)
Budesonide (tried twice, doesnt do anything)
(Maybe i forgot one)

And right now i use Skyrizi.
I started around six months ago.
After the second IV i felt a little bit more energetic which got my hope up.
However my calprotectine levels soon started climbing again and the improvement went away.

Yesterday i heard from my IBD docter that i will be scheduled for another colonoscopie.
(Which i am not excited about).

Also my options are getting more and more limited. 
Surgery is not recommended because the crohns is spread across my whole digestive system (throat, stomach, small/large intestine and fistulas), therefore the chance of succes is significantly lower.

Honestly i feel like crying every day.
I do every thing i can, i follow doctors orders, take medication on time, go to every appointment.
I even go the cognitive behavior therapie to deal with my exhaustion on advice of my crohns doctor.
I am just so tired of feeling exhausted and getting my hopes up, just to be let down again.

Also i have been partialy sick at work (i work 50%) for the last 9months and there is more pressure on me to recover quickly.

Maybe i need a restart of the Skyrizi of maybe the doctor recommends something new.
Personaly i want to try Rinvoq,
Its supposed to help with exhaustion and it would be nice to not have to inject.
But my doctor is kind of against the Rinvoq...

Its kind of a rant but i dont have anyone in my life that is going though something simular.

160,Humira,Skyrizi side effects,"Hey everyone, 
Ive posted here a few times about my journey as well as responded to a few of you in the past. I am not new to Crohns or biologics in general but I am new to Skyrizi. I was previously on Humira and Rinvoq. Humira was stopped about 3 weeks ago and Rinvoq in May. I got my first Skyrizi injection a month ago today but I noticed over the past week I’ve been experiencing some strange side effects. Due to the side effects I was told to pause my Azathioprine and I haven’t started Entivyo. This is a heavy cocktail of medications with the hopes of shutting my immune system down so I can stop having the awful flares and complications that I’ve experienced in the past 5-6 years. Anyways about a week ago I noticed I started breaking out in hives on my neck. As the days went on the hives gradually came on and each day it seems like I have more. I’ve taken antihistamines, topical creams and stayed away from fragrances products as well such as soaps and perfumes. I haven’t had any changes to my diet or lifestyle since I have started the Skyrizi and no other new medications either. Along with the hives I have absolutely no appetite and have been overly nauseous losing about 10 pounds this week alone. The hives are a bit strange (although in the past I have gotten rashes and hives from other medications). I have patches of hives on my neck, the right side of my face, my stomach, both sides of my back(not connected) and one side it’s going all the way down to my thigh area. I spoke with the pharmacist in town and she told me it’s possible this is some kind of delayed reaction. The GI hasn’t gotten back to me and I’m due to have my shot on Tuesday. Has anyone experienced this ? I’ve looked all over the internet and I seen most people don’t have any side effects on this drug and honestly I was hoping it would do some good for me in my situation. If anyone has experienced this, what did you do to calm it down? And how long did it last ? The oral antihistamines have not made it better and the topicals seems to make it much worse. Showers along with the heat seem to raise them even more as well. I was told to keep some Benadryl in case my throat starts to feel as if it is closing up because I’ve had anaphylaxis in the past with other drugs. I’m really nervous about getting my next infusion so any input is appreciated. 

Edit 
I also forgot to mention that I did have headaches immediately after the first infusion( the first week or two) and I have also been extremely tired not being able to wake up in the morning and then some nights just not sleeping at all even though I’m tired.

They did a colonoscopy and the doc said if I didn't want to be on meds I was fine for now. 

Fast forward to today and had a colonoscopy and doc told me I have to get back on something now, that's fine with me if I need to I need to. We ran some tests and I can still do Humira because somehow I don't have antibodies.  

So how is Humira different from 6 years ago? Anything I should prepare? It's been a while, I'm a bit nervous.",2024-06-24 02:41:48,CrohnsDisease,7,1dn34io,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dn34io/how_do_you_like_humira_now_its_been_6_years/,2024-06-24

I had my hyrimoz injection yesterday and I hope that helps. Im kinda scared of all of this, I built a life since 2017 (girlfriend, kids, sports) and now I feel im letting everyone down plus no one understands the disease.

164,Humira,"Well, shit…","So here I am. Still at the rehabilitation clinic/nursing home, eating double portion of soft foods made for old people. I’ll receiving in IV fluids half of what’s my ileostomy output is. I’m still averaging about 3.5 liters a day, but on a positive note, my waste is becoming more solid and it’s starting to resemble poop a lot more than the beginning, when it just looked like chewed up food in digestive juices. (Yes, I know that’s what it was, but now it looks more like poop and has the consistency of oatmeal, instead of cereal in milk, if that makes any sense.”

Anyway, good news first. I saw my surgeon yesterday and first words out of his mouth was, “wow! You look so much better than the last time I saw you! You were emaciated!” I said, “I feel so much better! I’ve gained almost 20 lbs since the surgery!” (Happened about a month ago. Weighed in at 106 then. Weighed in at 133 today.) Being a fella who’s about 5’9”, I need to gain about 15-20lbs more, but I want to build my muscle up first. Otherwise that’s going to create mobility issues for me as my muscles have atrophied and I don’t want that. 

Given my fairly rapid recovery, the surgeon is not too concerned about the volume of my output. He said, “yeah, so the rate you’re healing at, I can reattach everything back up before your small intestine starts absorbing liquids. We’ll have you on the IV fluids at night to replenish what you’re not absorbing, but I think we can reattach everything by august.”

This is tremendous news. AUGUST!!!! 

Now for the bad news. 

Went and saw my GI doctor. Super cool guy. Has crohn’s himself, so he’s very understanding. I lucked out. Had some blood work done, lab results came in. 

So my body is developing antibodies AGAINST Humira. So he’s going to put me on a drug called methotrexate, if you know what that is. He wants me to continue on Humira once every other week and take methotrexate once a week. 

https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3441/methotrexate-anti-rheumatic-oral/details

Just looking at the side effects I’m thinking, “what in the actual fuck am I taking here?!?!”

So the adventure never stops and sadly, the nightmare never ends. 

Mixed bag of a couple of days. 

Oh and now I am on twenty one different medications. Some I have to take twice a day, some three times, some four times, some once, some once a week (and if I misdose, I could fucking DIE I guess, so that’s cool.) some once every other week, some I have to taper. Some are to make me constipated to slow my intestinal motility and some to make me poop. 

My body doesn’t know whether to shit or go blind. 

It’s a lot of shit to keep track of. Not to mention logging all my output so that I can replace it with IV fluids. To be honest, I’d prefer to stay here where there are medical professionals on staff 24/7, who bring me my meds on schedule and all that, but I don’t want to be here until august either. 

Plus, I’m such a better cook than the kitchen here… 

Anyway, I hope you guys and gals are having a better day than I am.

I am currently taking Humira and it is going quite well, but I am mildly concerned with the adverse effect of mass amount of medication going into my body now and when I get older. I follow a lot of holistic social media influencer and read books/studies/articles about natural remedies for autoimmune issues such as Crohn’s.

Only thing weird ever noticed is extremely large bowel movements (not like the Chrohns I know) and a reoccurring mild stomachache at noon. Humira is good for the arthritis and Chrohns so that's what was prescribed. They also said other medications which were never prescribed didn't work (I get why they did it for insurance but what if one would have worked and isn't a black label medicine). I was scared to say no to Humira, it's what the Drs prescribed, but I really think I want a more holistic Dr. I do not treat my Chrohns personally and have been out of work 12 years, so clearly I want something that works for my son but this Humira gives me a bad feeling.",2024-06-13 15:54:31,CrohnsDisease,0,1df2cfn,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1df2cfn/what_if_i_stop_humira/,2024-06-13

171,Humira,Imuran vs Humira,"I have been diagnosed with CD in 2017 when I was 16 years old. I took prendisone and started with Imuran back then and I achieved remission fairly quickly back then. I continued drinking Imuran untill last year and then stopped (big mistake).

Now I've been slowly flaring up since March of this year. My GI prescribed to me two weeks ago Budosanide (which has been already working) and Imuran again. One week after taking Imuran I started feeling really nauseous, I totally lost my appetite and had pain in the upper part of my stomach. I went to the GI, did a blood test and it came out with absolutely no issues.

She told me then to stop drinking Imuran for 4 days and if I feel better (which I already do) I will probably have to start treating my CD with a biologic which is going to be Humira.

Any experience of people switching from Imuran to Humira?  
How long does it take until it works? Are the side effects of Humira worse than the side effects of Imuran? I would really like to gain some weight again, is it going to happen with Humira?

173,Humira,Perianal Crohns Rant,"I’ve had perianal Crohn’s for 6 years about with fissures, abscesses, a thrombosed hemorrhoid that required surgery, proctitis.

I’ve had a fissurectomy and botox down there about 1 year ago to treat the fissures with no success. 

No fistulas yet thankfully.

I was being treated with humira for past 4 years until I had a terrible reaction causing small fiber neuropathy (just paresthesia and weird sensations) and separately had sepsis + hospital for 5 days. I stopped biologics for now :(

The fissures and ulceration downstairs are awful. The ulcers are comparable to the ones that show up in your mouth but on and around my bunghole. I have tried all creams and ointments and diet changes and exercise. No alcohol anymore etc. I am a scientist and am anal about following precise regiments and documenting results. But nothing correlates! 

About 3 years ago I almost had an ostomy bag installed, but I chickened out. The thought of having a barbie butt terrifies me. 

I opted to manage things conservatively. Supported by a regiment of almost daily pain med usage (norco 10mg/day), sitz baths, bamboo toilet paper, abstinence from a variety of foods etc.

This regiment was largely successful in preventing ER visits and keeping my sanity and allowing me to live a mostly normal life.

I’ve recently moved regions and finding a local pain management practice to help has been stupidly difficult. Since the pain meds were the cornerstone of my “conservative” treatment and I do not have access yet, My symptoms are taking over my life again. I am exhausted

I am once again considering the ostomy bag because 1.) I am tired of the regiment I have to follow and 2.) convincing doctors that I am suffering enough to prescribe a narcotic pain medication is exhausting and humiliating.

My butthole constantly looks like a dissolving steak and I am just tired of managing it.

I am once again in the ER for pain relief so I can hopefully sleep tonight.

I’ve birthed three kids and one of them was a csection but I would go through those labors once a month if I could stop the back pain for the rest of the month. It’s an 11. I cry and cry. I have mild stomach upset or pain but a fair amount of diarrhea. All the back pain. My GI doesn’t think it’s related and I’ve had lots of testing for ankylosing spondylitis and other arthritis things. It eventually was diagnosed as fibro.

I (18F) was diagnosed in Oct.2023. To sum it up as quick as I can, from March-September 2023 my health very quickly started to plummet. There were symptoms I had before then but my doctor thought nothing of it and continually pushed me off (ofc) it wasn’t until I got a new PCP, and my symptoms worsened tremendously that I got the attention I needed. I was completely bedridden for almost all of august, (had my incredibly sad graduation party on august 2nd, during which I had to stay sat on a park bench for the entirety of it because of how sick I felt, and everyone was excusing it for “college stress” and I would hide in the bathroom crying). That was the last time I left my house. From then through all of September and October, I couldn’t leave my bed and was living to and from the bathroom and my bedroom. (Expect for appointments which I very slowly had to painfully wobble myself to the car) finally got in with the GI; got the diagnosis, started treatment (started on Humira) and have been slowly uphill from then.
Some good things did happen, I saw family across the country in December which was amazing.. but ever since I got to a manageable level of feeling okay, I hit such a wall.
I’ve lost a lot of relationships that I can’t get back. Friends from high school I promised to stay in contact with, and my girlfriend (whom we mutually ended the relationship) because who wants to date someone who’s sick all of time? 
In December, taking my injections started getting really difficult and I began to have bad reactions to the injection site. (Surprise surprise the meds aren’t working). Had my second scope just a couple weeks ago and it’s still extremely inflamed so I’m on steroids again, and will be trying a new med soon.
I just don’t know what to do with myself. I’m only 18, I “have so much ahead of me” but I’m so depressed and anxious all the time. My PCP wants me to try a new antidepressant again (I tried lexapro awhile ago but it wasn’t working so I stopped) I haven’t had any interest in starting any again because it just feels like one more thing I have to medicate and one more thing my body is failing to do correctly. So I’m sitting at the “well.. it’s severe but you’re managing” conversation I had with my PCP about it and my attitude is, I DO have a choice in medicating for my anxiety, I don’t have a choice for medicating my Crohn’s.

I don’t know guys I just want to be healthy, I want to be happy, I want to meet people again and see friends again. I wanna go to school and travel, I wanna do all the things I’m supposed to be doing now. But I’m not. I’m living at home, working part time down the street, miserable. I wanna leave so bad but all my doctors are here and no choice I put on the table seems realistic or appealing.
I feel so “unwell”. My pain is up and down, but most days there’s not debilitating pain that gets in the way. But the fatigue kills me. And I just feel sick, like I know something’s wrong. I don’t feel right and there’s nothing I can do about it.",2024-05-14 17:27:53,CrohnsDisease,16,1crxu2w,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1crxu2w/anyone_else_feel_so_absolutely_defeated_they_dont/,2024-05-14
179,Humira,Why do Biologics fail?,"I (30 M) have had Crohn’s since 2017. Since then, I have been on Humira (worked for 8 months but then failed, had antibody test done that showed NO ANTIBODYS, just very low trough levels but I had already switched to entivyo before the results came back. Entivyo worked for 2 years, then symptoms came back. Stelara never worked. Inflectra with 6MP worked for 2 years then stopped recently. I’m left with Rinvoq and Skyrizzi. My question is why do the meds always stop working? What causes that? I have been on the same BP meds for 20 years and it’s still working, why is this different!? It’s so frustrating. I’m on prednisone now for the time being, I have my GI appt tomorrow to see what we will try next. Is it possible to circle back to Humira and just increase the dose since technically I never developed antibodies to it, I just had low trough levels? What about Entivyo with 6MP, or 6MP with Humira? I don’t want to keep burning through my options. ",2024-05-07 14:04:47,CrohnsDisease,28,1cmcphq,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cmcphq/why_do_biologics_fail/,2024-05-07
180,Humira,Been on amjavita 6 months with no improvement,"Hey y'all, I was diagnosed with uc 23 years ago. Asacol worked the first year then it went in remission for about 8 years then came and went on and off up until 2017. It's now been non-stop for the last 7 years and nothing is working. I was 212 lbs and went down to 129 in only a few months. Been on way to much Prednisone since the diagnoses along with asacol and sulfasalazine 
Which both quit working years ago. I was put on humira for 2 months and then my new insurance made me switch to amjavita. I've been on that for almost 6 months now and I'm doing an injection every 2 weeks and have noticed no improvement. Still going to the bathroom 15-25 times a day and the mornings are by far the worst. I'm losing so much blood I don't know how I'm still alive. I've had to get blood transfusions a few times because my hemoglobin was between a 5-6. Highest it ever gets is 10 but it doesn't stay that high long. I have absolutely no quality of life anymore. I can't do basic things or go anywhere which is very depressing. My pain is always severe and it's at around a 6 on my best days which is rare. Any of you guys had these issues ? What did you switch to or what has actually worked for y'all ? I've been to Dr after Dr and have tried everything I can think of with no luck. I even begged them to take my colon out but they won't. They keep saying that they are confident that they can get it in remission soon. I'm out of time. This disease had completely changed me as a person. I'm not the person I used to be and this has caused me to be someone I hate because I'm always in pain and miserable. Can't eat, sleep, lay on either side, be in hot weather, stand or walk for long.

181,Humira,Questions for those of you who recently switched from Humira to Hyrimoz,"Ive been on Humira for 5 years. My doctors office sent my pharmacy a prescription for Hyrimoz assuming my insurance was going to stop covering Humira in April. It turns out my insurance still covers Humira. I'm trying to decide if I should go through the headache of getting re-prior authorized for Humira or just stick with Hyrimoz now. 

My questions for those of you who recently made the switch from Humira to Hyrimoz:

1. Is the injection more painful?
2. Have you noticed if it has the same effectiveness as Humira?
3. If you have tried Sandoz's rebate program, how is it?",2024-04-24 21:28:26,CrohnsDisease,2,1cca6fa,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cca6fa/questions_for_those_of_you_who_recently_switched/,2024-04-24

Started on my first infusion of Stelara on Wednesday after Humira had stopped working. I have never experienced fatigue quite like it as a side effect.

Has anyone had experiences in terms of managing the fatigue, or how long this aspect of the drug may last for. It's fairly consuming as I just simply dont have the energy to do a whole lot at the moment.

December 2023 I had my first dose of Humira (prescribed by my rheumatologist bc I’m special and have RA and Crohns 🙄). 
April 2024 my new GI discussed results of February MRI with me (which showed signs of Crohns, which we knew) and he wants to do ANOTHER colonoscopy in 1-2 months to have “clinical evidence” that I am improving … I told him I had been feeling much better after starting Humira. 
Isn’t this too soon? Why not wait at least a year from last colonoscopy or a year from start of Humira? Why 9-10 months?

185,Humira,Completerebate.com,"I am still in shock that this worked. My son is on Humira and Xeljanz and has patient assistance cards for both medications. Every month when it is time to refill his meds the specialty pharmacy has to verify the funds on the copay assistance cards and gives us the option to pay the huge copay upfront if we can’t wait for verification. I spoke with one customer service representative who was so incredibly helpful and mentioned something I had never heard of before which is completerebate.com. Where they will reimburse you for what you paid minus the $5 copay that the assistance card does not cover.

Steps taken:
1. Call copay assistance card program and ensure the necessary funds are available 
2. Call specialty pharmacy and PAY the painfully large copay without using the assistance card
3. Submit your EOB and credit card receipt showing payment for your medication
4. Get a check in the mail 

The biggest benefit and I feel like I just gained a cheat code in life is that the money I spent to pay for the medication goes towards our deductible and gets us one stop closer to our out of pocket maximum for the year! I wish I could hug the customer service rep that told me about this program.

186,Humira,Today I turn 25 and I have never felt older ,"Hi everyone, for context: I was diagnosed at 15 and had a partial terminal ileum bowel resection at that time. I have been through two biologics and about to switch to a third as I’ve stopped responding to Entyvio. I was on Humira for the first seven years of my diagnosis, then started taking Budenisone in combination with Humira, and now have been on Entyvio the last two years and have started becoming symptomatic again. I went to the ER a few weeks ago because I was worried about another obstruction. The only “good” news was that there was no inflammation in my small intestine or ileum, but there is considerable inflammation in my colon all the way to through my rectum. I have never had this problem before. I’ve now been on prednisone for over a month and the lowest I could taper down to has been 15mg. Once I taper to 10mg I start feeling symptomatic again with watery stool at least five times a day and major fatigue. I guess the point of this post is just to vent. Today I turn 25 and I feel like I’m 85. I don’t know if I need another surgery or what, but I am getting so sick of feeling sick. I’m scared I won’t be able to start a family one day. I’m worried I’ll lose my job.

187,Humira,"Crohn’s, psoriasis, &amp; knee pain — a trifecta! ","Hi all,  

I (23 F)  know that there’s been recent activity in here talking about symptoms that go along with Crohn’s and I was wondering if I could get some advice from anybody whose dealt with similar situations. 

I got diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2012. I originally was on Remicade, went into anifilatic shock, then was put on Humira. I lasted about 3 years with humira - due to the fact that it gave me severe psoriasis (which I had never had previous) head to toe. In 2017, I was then put on Stelara. It felt like a miracle drug. Was working great for my Crohn’s and on top of it my psoriasis cleared up completely. 

I am now 23 and am dealing with excruciating knee pain. I love to run, but haven’t the last several months due to knee pain and swelling. I went to the drs numerous times and they told me I have a couple cysts on both of my knees. However the cysts themselves are not painful so they didn’t do anything about them. I have been going to PT, but still the pain persists and my knees just seem to have a mind of its own. I can’t get into a full squatting position without my joints crying for me to stop. My knees pop and crack every time I am on the ground or sit on my legs.  Today I can’t even extend my knees completely without the feeling that they will buckle under me. 

Any suggestions as to what I should do? Specific specialist? Switch meds? I am fortunate enough to have only had 2 bad flare ups (1 being my initial diagnosis) within the past 12 years, I just worry that changing meds is going to make other issues more prevalent and/or not help joint pain at all. I’ve been going to drs about this for roughly 4 years now and I feel like I’m going in circles.

188,Humira,My tips with living with crohns  and working 40-72 hr weeks. For the past 20 yr career,"1. Eat small portions until your content and not overly stuffed
2. Eat the same things majority of the time that are safe for you. [Strict diet]
3. Get on a medication that works. [Humira, stelera, remicade].Even if it helps alittle that's a win. Most of them will not completely cure it. I use self injection due to busy schedule. Don't have time to do infusions.
4. Pain killers will stop having to run to bathroom 10 times in 2 hrs. Calms the stomach 
5. Exercising, drinking water

Good luck

I’ve been in an active awful nonstop pain flare for 3 months now and my ct scan from a few wks ago shows severe narrowing next to the surgical site and small bowel dilation is 4.5 cm. Sooooooo my question being—can the meds reverse the stricture? How can they tell on a scan if it’s inflammatory or due to scarring? I’m just so nervous that this drug could do wonders but I’ll still be in pain bc of the stricture. The last thing I want rn is to go thru that surgery again :( helpppppp!

190,Humira,Infusions vs Injections,"Hi guys! 

At the beginning of this year, I failed my second biologic. I was receiving infusions since June 2021. The second treatment went well for a little while, but then just seemed to randomly stop working. 

To switch it up, my new doctor started me on Humira (after an 8-week round of steroids), and I started the injections a few weeks ago. 

For those who have experience with Humira or other self-injection biologics, how long did it take for you to feel better or feel a difference? When I was getting infusions, it was almost instant. I could feel it working and I would feel better almost immediately. The exhaustion from the infusion would kick my ass, but my stomach would stop hurting and the bloating would go down. I would only start to feel bad a few days before I was supposed to get my next infusion. 

Now, I'm a week out from my second Humira dose, and I feel like shit. I don't feel any better after having the shot. Even on the day I do it, I still don't feel better. I feel nauseous all the time and I am still seeing blood when I use the bathroom.  Does this mean it's not working for me? Or does it take time? My doctor's office hasn't exactly been helpful in giving me an idea about what to expect, or any kind of preparation, so I wanted to hear from others.

193,Humira,Combining the risk of global war with a chronic illness ?,"Hi, 

I'm not native English, then my wordings will be pretty rough sorry. And I do not really know by what I need to begin then I will try to be quick. I have read this Reddit multiple time this last 2 month and never got the courage to speak. 

Since multiple day I have some difficulty to sleep, I tend to push the bed time farer each night. And tonight it's already 4AM. I live in France. And I have an Crohns one since my 16 years Old. (I'm 28).

I do not really speak about it, I tend to do the maximum to not think about it. I never look at my analysis results by anxiety and let this to my doctor. In resume I'm the ""Dude with no guts"". I had never written somewhere or to anyone about this illness. And I think that I have ""light"" symptoms, no pains since more than 10 years. But every coloscopie are ""Bad"" they found necrosis or infection. Then they replace my treatment, I remind that I have tried Humira, remicad, pentaza and now I'm on Stelara since 2 years. It's look fine for the moment  but analysis are never totally good. They continue to supervise but recently they had accepted to not impose me a coloscopy for 2 to 3 years cause the last 2 years with stellara there his only few ""traces"" of disease. I feel a little better but, I'm tired. (And glad to not drink this vicious liquid again... For at least 2 years.) 

And I know that I need a treatment, Idk if this remissions probability his something or not. But I need them until this will happen. And ... They are expensive. I have 1 Stelara injection every month. And I have read that this injection cost nearly 8k euros. I'm glad to live in France. But I feel bad. I have no ""control"". I depend of it. I have no possibility to generate 8k euros a month. I work half time, when I'm not too tired. I'm a person who benefits, I don't offer much in return.I offer what I can. But I don't feel I can offer more at the moment. As long as I'm ill, I'll continue to cost more than I bring. 

And there his a lot of tension in this big world. Recently in France, cause of the economy. They speak about the ""Social security"" and the cost of ""Chronic illness patients"" they want to erase some illness of the list of ""Illness that are taken in charge without cost"". I don't think they will touch to Crohn but It's make me unease. And I know the world sittuation, the war tension. With Russia and everything around this subject. I don't know what to do about it. I have no control. 

What if I will not be able to continue stellara ? 

Did someone with Crohn's disease can survive this kind of event ? 

There his alternative or less expensive, more widespread treatment that can be taken has replacement In the event of war and supply disruption ? Or habits to adopt to reduce the chances of having problems when you have to stop your treatment? 

Every time I ask my doctor about a solution that will prevent me to depend of a medication he laugh it cause my motivation are lunar. I know they are lunar... But all this tension do not diminish and I feel like from a day to another I could end without medication. 

I've heard of an ostomy (the operation that puts a pouch on the outside). I have few consequences of Crohn's. But I wonder if having one would allow me to stop taking medication and survive a war? But doing it for someone with almost no symptoms must be useless? Or it's probably a bit overkill too... But this solution can't be discussed with my doctor and he think I'm on the good way. In fact 2 of them think it cause I asked a second advice.

And now I see that I have writed too much and I do not know if all this have sens. There his questions yes... But if you do not have answer to them it's fine. At least I have writed this outside my head. And I hope that everyone will be fine in case everything become bad.

195,Humira,My Experience and struggles.,"Hi all

I just wanted to write my story, I never talk about it. Figured it could help. I also dont beat around the bush, I say it how it is. TLDR: Its shit.

I'm new to this reddit channel but i'm far from new to crohn's, I was diagnosed at 18 with crohns and got a bonus side gift of mild pericarditis. I am now 43. I knew from a much earlier age 10-13 I had issues with my rear end. Kids being kids getting into mischief would cause me to need a toilet asap, sometimes behind a bush if a toilet wasn't near.  


At around age 23ish I had my first bag due to a collapsed bowel 3 days after coming home to australia from london. Things in surgery happened and I also got a mucous fistula so i went from getting a bag to now having 2 bags attached. 5 weeks earlier I was an excited 20 year old going to see the world. A year goes bye, I have reversal surgery. YAY  


Few years and some ups and downs go by and I need another bag, bowel flaring and collapsing. Fair enough. Im around 28 years old at this point. I deal with it for another 2 years. Bags removed.  


A few years go by and i'm in my early 30's now i'm getting a really sore bum. Another colonoscopy later and im told I have perianal abscess. Great, Now I have surgery to place setons (drains) in my butt to allow the abscess  to drain. Whilst this happens my other butt cheek is sore, Back to hospital for another seaton in the other cheek as now I have 2 abscess, cut the story short, I ended up with 4 setons in my bum to drain many abscess.   


Well now they wont heal after 12 months im informed I need another bag. Back to hospital and I have to have a bag to help my abscess heal by bypassing my rear end to stop poo passing through the drains and abscess's. Well 2 years later im told im never going to have the bag removed as my bowel has to many small holes in it from the abscess and setons where if they did reverse me id have an internal sprinkler system of poo. Its actually now at a point where i'm being told I need a proctectomy (remove bum completely and internals) also known as a barbie butt. That's how they remove the perianal abscess tracts from your reat, cut them out.  


I have had my current bag now for so long its ruined my skin, red raw, raw like a burn. it weeps  like a healing burn, Therefor I have trouble with bags staying on, the last 8 nights my bag has come of in bed 5 times. Im a master at washing and making beds. I have also got pyoderma gangrenosum where the bag is located so its also a big reason the bags wont hold. Another side effect of Crohns. Also i have surgical hernia (very large) where my bag is currently located, so when I wear any clothing you can very easily see my bag as the hernia pushed it out.  


I dont want to be a negative nancy in my story but I just want people to see a different side of what happens with crohns. It ruins you, as time goes on it does not get better. My point is try and enjoy every day you can because when you think your having a bad day, trust me you will learn later on what you thought was a bad day was only a mediocre day and it just gets worse.

Oh and don't get me started on teeth, there all gone too. do everything you can to keep your teeth in order.  
15 surgeries in total so far and I know there is more to come.

I have had so many drugs over time, methotrexate, humira, infliximab all the steroids and yes they make you feel better but in the long term there all a band aid. How can these drugs be helping the rest of your body? Its very difficult in many ways and we all have different outcomes. We just need to hold our heads up and push on.  
My ears are always swollen and my belly button weeps and supposedly thats a thing from infliximab too. I could go on with many more problems but its now 2:58 am and im of to try and sleep on the couch.

It sucks but on the bright side of having a bag, you don't poo your pants when your out and about no more lol, just the bed when it falls off hahaha.

196,Humira,Looking to see if anyone has had these issues..,"To preface I've been diagnosed with Crohn's for a while and have basically been in 'remission' for about 2 and a half years on humira.

Since around June last year I started to feel REALLY bad, but as I have small bowel crohns I've never had any bleeding, urgency or anything similar. I just feel like absolute crap, major brain fog and fatigue which triggers huge feelings of depersonalisation, anxiety and panic, achy joint, balance issues when walking as though I'm on a ship and have to grab hold of things to stabilise myself, muscle weakness/ fatigue, tinnitus, really noticeable shallow breathing, internal buzzing.

I went to my doctor who ran some bloods and said my ferritin was low (8 ug/l) but everything else was fine, i had a capsule endoscopy which showed gastritis but nothing else so I had an iron infusion and supplemented for 3 months and managed to get it up to around 87 ug/l. Things got mildly better but still I was unable to work or socialise. 

I have a feeling it may be my B12 but due to me supplementing heavily and eating plenty of fortified foods I believe my blood test might be falsely elevated (according to the good people over at r/B12deficency) and I'd have to stop supplementing for 4 months to get an accurate reading, which my doctor echoes. So instead of this I've paid to have B12 injections weekly and also all the cofactors to help alongside it and I'm praying this will help as I don't know how much more I can take of feeling like this, I feel like I'm holding up the life of my beautiful girlfriend as I can't work to help bring in money and I haven't got the energy to have holidays/ breaks or even as far as going out to walk the dog.

Has anybody else had these symptoms but they weren't related to anything I've mentioned? Just trying desperately to help myself here as the doctors don't seem to care enough.

Thanks all 

Edit: I forgot to mention, despite the minimal improvement I had after iron infusions, I now feel as bad as I ever have.",2024-03-08 21:51:14,CrohnsDisease,6,1ba0ekc,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ba0ekc/looking_to_see_if_anyone_has_had_these_issues/,2024-03-08
197,Humira,It was a crying silently into a towel in the shower kind of night. For some reason I started writing down my journey. I am going to share it. ,"My journey is atypical. But as a crohn’s and sarcoidosis sufferer and an RN for 16 years, I have learned everyone’s is different. 

Disclaimer: this is very long so if you don’t have the patience for it,‘that’s ok!

So I grew up in a tumultuous household and had ptsd from an early age. Sometimes it would affect my digestive tract. It was always chalked up to anxiety - which it probably was. I learned around age 14 that I suffered from familial thrombocytopenia. They didn’t really know why but my mom had passed the disease on to all of her children. Along with that I always had some level of iron deficiency. I went on to have cystic ovaries and had one burst and hemorrhage causing emergency surgery to cauterize, had an infected gal bladder removed, chronic tonsillitis that were removed, and an infected appendix that was removed all by age 24. So I was in my first year of RN school in 2006 age 25 and my family and I had come down with a stomach virus. Everyone recovered after about a week. Except me. I continued to suffer from nausea and loose stools for about 6 months. I went to a GI dr and he said “it’s probably viral but let’s get a colonoscopy scheduled.” So three more months passed and then I had the colonoscopy. As soon as I woke up in recovery my MD was there showing me pictures of the cobblestone bleeding ulcerations throughout my small and large intestines. He said “we took biopsies but it’s no doubt severe Crohn’s disease. Take prednisone and mesalamine and see me in 3 months.” Then he walked out. Now I wasn’t someone who panicked or overreacted. I considered myself pretty strong considering what I had already experienced in life. But I was quite taken aback with the abrupt nature of his words and subsequent departure. I spent the next few months suddenly feeling fine because of the prednisone. I weaned off and got sick again. I also graduated with my RN degree (associate’s) and started working at a hospital. I ended up changing drs to someone who actually spent the time to talk with me and listen to my concerns. That is when I started remicade and went into remission. I’ll fast forward the next few years for the sake of attempting any brevity possible. So that same year I met my husband who was another RN working overnights with me. Blah blah we got married and had 3 kids. So when I was pregnant I learned I had to stop remicade in the third trimester. I was nervous but it ended up being fine. The low platelets caused me to have to have a c section with general anesthesia. My GI and I stayed in contact and he told me we could decide to restart the humira once I was done breast feeding. That time came and I still had no crohns symptoms. I ended up having two more children (all 3 within 3 yrs and 11 months 🤪). Fertility not a problem here! lol. But through all of it I stayed in remission. Or so I thought. During my third c section I hemorrhaged and ended up with a hematocrit of 19. They sent me home without transfusing me and I did not really give it much thought. I had a new baby, 18 month old, and 3 yr old to take care of. Over the next 6 months I found myself extremely tired with constant nausea but just assumed it was having a new baby plus the other 2 and my hormones readjusting. I started craving and eating ice to a crazy amount. I did figure it was hormonal and probably PICA from pregnancy hormones leveling out. Still, I was exhausted and went to my PCP. He ordered  labs, I got them drawn, and I didn’t hear back from him. No news must be good news! Now in hindsight I am a total idiot. But at the time I wasn’t getting proper oxygen to my brain. Lol. So 6 more months passed! I still was like “god. I am so fucking sick feeling.” I returned to my PCP. He said “oh. Well you never got your labs drawn so I assumed you felt better.” My jaw dropped. I said, “yes I did!” He looked and said, “they never ran them.” So off I went for labs. That night around 11PM he calls me and this is the conversation:

MD: “Are you feeling ok?”
Me: “Besides feeling as horrible as always, yeah.”
MD: “This is serious. Are you having chest pain?”
Me: “Not at the moment but I have 3 young kids so it’s pretty common.” *chuckles*
MD: “Well your hematocrit is 18, your ferritin is 1, and your hemoglobin is 5. You need to go to the hospital for transfusions.”
Me: “Can I go in the morning? I’ve been like this for one year.”
MD: *pauses* “Ok. But you must go as soon as you get up.”
Me: “ok.”

So the weirdest thing happened then. My mouth started watering at the idea of receiving a blood transfusion. It was the oddest thing. Time for more fast forwarding:

So I go through the transfusions and iron infusions for the next couple months. They also do ct scans. My GI calls me and says “you have an entire section of swollen mesenteric lymph nodes that need to be biopsied. They look possibly malignant.” Sigh. I go have them biopsied (I’m skipping months here because it’s just too damned much) and the surgeon speaks to my husband and says, “I got a good few removed and they are most likely lymphoma. If they aren’t they are sarcoidosis but that is incredibly rare and unlikely.” 

Biopsy result call: 4 days later: “We found granulomas so it’s gastric sarcoidosis. You need an endoscopy to check your stomach lining.” I was actually disappointed. I know this sounds fucked up but I knew lymphoma had a chance of being cured. Sarcoidosis was just another autoimmune disease and even more rare. Of course then I have the gastric only form. So they do my endoscopy and lo and behold, more granulomas and chronic inflammation of my stomach lining. I go to rheumatology. They put me on prednisone. They put me back onto remicade. Second infusion I have an anaphylactic reaction. Of course I do. I switch to humira. Still on prednisone. I develop cdiff. I need a fecal transplant. It actually cures it and I have no further large intestine issues. Then I develop a perianal abscess. I have it I and D’d at the bedside. That was my 10/10 pain. Worst decision of my medical history. Over the next 3 years I struggle with abscesses because they discover I have a perianal fistula. They do a colonoscopy and can’t find any disease in my rectum but the fistula is sort of like - duh. About to get TMI but I actually participate in anal sex and believe it started from my husband scratching me with his fingernail when I was on prednisone for 6 months. Anyway over the next 3 years I have 11 surgeries to I&amp;D the area and shrink the abscess cavity. The original abscess was the size of a softball. I thought it was a hemorrhoid for about a month before I finally went to the ED septic. But all this time I have a lloose seton in. Then I have 2 failed LIFT surgeries and finally 1 failed muscle flap surgery where I said “I’m done with surgeries and I’m just going to live with my seton and fistula.”  Best decision ever. I just keep a 2x2 gauze there and it doesn’t affect me whatsoever. SEx is fine and it’s only the width of dental floss. 

Fast forward to me at work: It’s July 2023 and I’m a homecare nurse. My mom who passed on the familial thrombocytopenia suddenly has worsening back pain. Now she is not a dramatic person.  Besides the low platelets she has had some disc degeneration but basically no other health history. She ends up going to the ED and they find a mass surrounding her lumbar spine. They biopsy it and find lymphoma. Now the weird thing about that is the type they find is a small B cell lymphoma but the way it is acting is like it is a LARGE B cell lymphoma. So the next step is always bone marrow biopsy. They go expecting to find lymphoma in there and they find chronic myeloid leukemia… uhhh. So the experts at the largest teaching hospital in this area are doing the thing they always do with my family, “huh. That’s interesting and not typical.” So my hematologist meets with my mom’s hematologist and they decide to do genetic platelet and bone marrow testing on us. So the platelet genetics come back that we have a very rare familial thrombocytopenia gene mutation ANKRD26. It is only been documented in 200 families ever in the world. We knew we were special but… it is in essence a bone marrow disorder mostly causing thrombocytopenia for life but “may” cause other autoimmune disease. So since this mutation also puts you at risk for CML, AML, and lymphoma, in July I have a bone marrow biopsy. The results show “no MARKEDLY abnormal bone marrow besides platelets.” It does show increased white blood cells. But when you have inflammatory disease that sort of happens. So my mom who is the poor guinea pig goes through chemo and now is in remission. There is no cure but she is on maintenance. 

We are almost there, I promise! So fast forward to November 2023: I have been doing homecare nursing for years. I go to see a patient who has 2 viscous German shepards. I’m smart and I follow the policies for safety and I ensure the patient’s dogs are secure before I enter. I see them enter the outdoor fenced in yard from my car and so I call the patient just for a double check and ask “are your dogs secured?” She says, “yes. You can come in.” I knock and she lets me in. I did the majority of the visit and I was about to do VS and I needed a pulse oximeter but I couldn’t find mine. So I asked her if she had one so I could check her oxygen saturation. She has one lung and it was her DC visit. She said yes she would just go grab it from the other room. Little did I know it was in the room where the dogs were! So as she’s trying to go in the room, the dogs slipped by her and come lunging at me immediately. I turn and ran as fast as I could but they are fucking German shepherds and one caught me and bit me on the back of the thighs two times.  Then the other one was there and bit me on the ankle so I started running towards the door and they blocked the door. Then I turned and ran up the stairs, hoping there was a bedroom I could hide in, and they grabbed my pants and pulled my pants completely off with their teeth and shredded them and kept chasing me. I ran, and I went to one of the bedrooms and closed the door, and then turned immediately and saw the dog was behind me barking in my face and had already gotten in the room! So I ran out of there and ran into another bedroom and the other dog was in there! Then I ran out of there and ran into the bathroom and locked myself in the shower, because there was two glass doors that could seal it. I hid in there hyperventilating while the dogs barked angrily at me from the other side of the glass. I was dripping blood in her shower. Eventually I heard the patient yelling for them and they retreated. Time passed and the patient yelled up that I could come back down. I tentatively made my way down the stairs pantsless with a thong on dripping blood down my legs and asked “do you know where my pants are?” She said “did they bite you?” I said “yes!” I went back upstairs and found my half shredded bloody pants. I had her sign out of her visit and I drove myself to the ED. I got there and basically collapsed into a wheelchair and the rest was a blur. They found 11 sets of bite marks on the backs of my legs. There is a reason I’m even sharing this. They put me on antibiotics and made me hold my humira…

Yes. So my crohns flares horribly. Not just in my stomach which is the main site the past 8 years. It spreads to my mouth. My entire mouth is inflamed with raw, bleeding ulcers. My lip swells to the point where people ask me if I’ve had lip injections. My lips bleed anytime I smile. I can barely eat due to mouth pain. By December 23rd my GI puts me on prednisone. The symptoms are controlled about 80%. It’s tolerable. He makes me have an emergency endoscopy and colonoscopy but by then I’ve been on prednisone for 2 months. The intestines look “pretty good,” the stomach has chronic inflammation and 6 bleeding ulcers, several biopsies also show granulomas and one polyp. They take mouth biopsies at ENT which show granulomas. I restart my humira. That brings me to today! We made it! I also found out my h pylori test was positive. I also am now weaning the prednisone. I’ve been over 40mg since December and my face is puffy and I’ve gained too much weight. My gi sent me to see infectious disease this past Tuesday. The ID doctor seemed flabbergasted by my history. It sounds impossible. He decided I will start quadruple therapy. 3 different antibiotics and protonix which I’m already on twice a day. Of course having an angry immune system, I have a history of several antibiotic allergies plus the remicade anaphylaxis. Starting one new antibiotic is scary. Three at once? With my history the ID Dr is prescribing IV Benadryl for me to administer as premeds and as needed. I of course have my epipen but getting epi sucks ass and I have had good results with IV Benadryl. Especially with my iron infusion reactions. Meanwhile, im down to 30mg of prednisone now and my mouth is raging. If anyone wants to see a crohn’s or sarcoidosis mouth flare, let me know. I photograph it every couple days I go to GI tomorrow and he is thinking of sending me to another system where he knows some experts. I also have to go get an EKG before starting one of the new meds due to it causing elongation of the QT interval. I sit here with throbbing mouth pain. While in the shower earlier, I got scared. I’m scared that I have such an atypical situation that none of my many specialists will actually be able to treat me. I’m tired but I have to stay active. I fake it. I don’t want people feeling sorry for me. I am sure I left some things out. 

Also my GI admits that crohns can sometimes cause granulomas. So is it crohns or sarcoidosis in the stomach? MY GI thinks it could be both. It doesn’t really matter since they both have the treatment of immunosuppression.

Oh and in December while recovering from the bite wounds, I finished and obtained my Bachelor’s degree in nursing. All while working full time and dealing with all that bullshit. I am applying now for psychiatric NP doctorate programs. The disease sucks! But I made a choice years ago to tell myself everyday, “You got this!” I do. I do got this. 

And all of you, if you’ve made it this far: WE got this. YOU got this. 

Thank you for reading.

198,Humira,Have to take Methotrexate for the first time after many failed Biologics and am worried!,"I've avoided taking Methotrexate for about 10 years (there seem to be a lot of side effects for some people). I've failed Humira, Entyvio and now Skyrizi isn't working well. When biologics work they are great and give me minimal side effects. But when they stop working it's a big flare.

I'm currently on budesonide and was hoping to start the approval process for Remicade. But it looks like I'll be forced to try Methotrexate first.  Is Methotrexate something you take as your only Crohn's medication? Can it really get you in remission? I've always heard biologics are the gold standard and now I have to try this for who knows how long. 

Plus, I'm really worried about the side effects. I can take Zofran for nausea but there seem to be some other major issues and it's hard on the liver/kidneys.

I wasn't expecting to have to try Methotrexate so I'm really thrown off here.",2024-02-26 22:01:42,CrohnsDisease,6,1b0u7je,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1b0u7je/have_to_take_methotrexate_for_the_first_time/,2024-02-26
199,Humira,Just diagnosed with bile reflux.,"Got back from the gastro today. Had an upper endoscopy. Confirmed it's bile rising in my throat . She put me on pantoprazole. Said try to restrict my diet. My diet is already so restricted I really cannot go much more. I like late night foods (8pm) I like laying flat at night ant not elevated. I feel absolutely hopeless and utterly defeated. 

I can't be on that medication for more than a year without severe side effects. I can't go without it because then it gets so bad the increase in cancers, darretts esophagus, and a multitude of other things show up. 

Because my insurance stopped approving humira in November, since then this and my Crohn's have been flaring like crazy. 

I guess a rant/question for you guys would be. 

Is it possible to not have bile like this if I switch medications? (From humira)

What can I eat?? Anything tomato is out. And pizza was a safe food for me. The only thing I've had since last week is ensure. I'm sick of it.

200,Humira,CVS Caremark will stop covering brand name Humira (some plans excluded),"Not sure if this has been posted about before, so sorry if this is redundant! But last month CVS Caremark announced that they will stop covering Abbvie’s Humira for most of their formularies on April 1st this year. If this applies to you, you should get a notification soon. They will approve a humira biosimilar, though nobody I’ve spoken to at Caremark or my doctors office has known which one. They will automatically request your doctor to update your prescription, so you don’t need to take action (unless you hear otherwise. 

I was worried about the switch to a biosimilar, because I’ve definitely heard anecdotal stories about them not working as well for some. But the larger body of evidence shows that they work just as well as brand name, so I’m trying not to be scared lol! My care team’s pharmacist told me that in order to be called and prescribed as a biosimilar, there must be a substantial amount of evidence that it has the same rate/level of effectiveness as the brand name. 

Just thought I’d post this in case anyone hadn’t heard yet, it would suck to be blindsided by this even if the change is unlikely to cause medical problems. It was a pain trying to get more info from Caremark about this in the past month but I just got the official notice now. 

We know our disease is very individual, so if you have concerns be sure to talk to your doctor about this! And some formularies will continue to cover brand name Humira, so I’d double check with Caremark if you’re unsure if it applies to you.

201,Humira,Pimple near anus?,"Hey all, this is kind of TMI but all of Crohn's is so whatever. I just had a horrible flare up was the sickest I've ever been but finally got my Humira (was waiting on it for insurance reasons) and it's worked right away I feel SO much better. However I developed what appears to be a pimple near my anus. It's sore but not very big and it has come to a head there's definitely white. It doesn't hurt any other time unless I touch it. Im just worried I was reading so many horror stories about abscesses and fistulas etc and freaking about whether I should get this checked or is it possible it can be just a regular pimple? I was on Prednisone burst and just stopped it and I have broken out from it, I tend to get boils etc and have one in my arm area as well so wondering if that's all it is?

204,Humira,Crohn and Chronic Pain,"I was diagnosed with very severe crohn a little more than a year ago after suffering for years. I was literally so close to death that if didnt go to the ER I would have died, not wanting to go into details but it was bad where I couldn't even walk more than a few steps if I push my self to along side all the ins and outs (I know it is different from one person to the other but for me it was everything I just have bad luck with both diseases and medicine side effects where I always get the rare and super rare stuff).

I am taking humira and prednisone for my disease for a while now and even though it is better than nothing like no diahria most of the time and little to no blood in stool (usually no visible blood) where I needed a blood transfusion before from blood loss. It is not perfect and the flare is still and have been on for 6 years now but slightly less agressive in the past year due to the medicine.

I cannot function normally due to the pain where even sitting hurts the pain in the intestine is not the worst (even though sometimes it is). I have pain all over my body from my joints and back and moatly the lower back. Even my muscles hurt. I also have chronic migraine so I cannot go without pain medicine and NSAIDs are just a big no for crohn even though they work and paracetamol just doesnt cut it not even a little. Specific migraine medicine are also a no since I used some which did decrease the migraine intervals and occurence but the side effects where of the super rare kind not going into details lets just say for example you read a simple sentece and you wont understand what you read or that you read it at all. So I am using tramadol for the pain so I can move around it doesnt get rid of all the pain but it make it barable (i take a low dose of 37.5 mg with paracetamol up to 4 times a day, i used to take the 50mg but taking less is better in the long term, if i want the pain to be really barable like if you have low pain tolerance i would need like dose of more than a 100 multiple times a day but I have high pain tolerance so I go for low dose that can make me feel a little normal, i did get fentanyl, morphine and oxycodone in the hospital while i was close to death and in so much pain i did see the dosages which where not low and even high and even then i was in pain but the pain then was out of this world and even then I thought I would get better if i just waited so i waited for days that got be close r to death each day). Now I did stop for around 2 months taking it where I took iboprufin sometimes during that period with paracetamol but well it didnt go well for my intestine and stomach. I also go of it every now and then for a week or so cold turkey like they say (i go with the pain so I could be better later but it just wont work since I would not be able to eat like I usually do or move around without so much pain, i can not even lift light stuff without intestine and joints pain and even just sitting its all pain). I am down to bearing with the pain if I know it will go away but no it does not and if it do it is just for moments of relief( I think endorphines are at play) i also read some research that for chronic pain and if severe it is bad to bear with it since it have bad long term effects on the nerves, brain and cognitive funtions. If I can go for body pain the migraine are a big no for me since imagine a migraine that without medicine can go on for weeks and it keeps getting worse and no you cannot sleep through it and it doesnt go with sleep but it can get worse even when you say it cannot.

So the disease has got my body in its whole and chronic migraine have got my mind.

I keep a positive view of life (but when i so someone doing the simple thing of moving around normally with no pain and overthinking of what would happen if i did that move I wish I could do that, the simple stuff). I just wish I was healthy. No one can understand how much he is blessed until his health is compromised.

So please share you thought with me.",2024-01-29 23:51:54,CrohnsDisease,2,1aea53e,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1aea53e/crohn_and_chronic_pain/,2024-01-29
205,Humira,Infliximab reaction- what next?,"I’ve been on infliximab for 9 months, loading doses x3 infusions every two weeks then at home injections every two weeks until last week when they switched me back to infusions due to low active levels in my blood work. So they were giving me a double dose infusion over two hours and within first 5 minutes, I had a non anaphylactic reaction, flushed bright red, burning pressure on face, couldn’t catch a breath and my blood pressure dropped to half what it had been. It was really scary but they stopped the infusion immediately and I was back to normal bar shock within 30 minutes. 

So I know some people have continued infusions despite reactions with Benadryl etc but what are the likely next steps? I’ve been on Humira before for 5 years til it stopped showing up in blood work. I’m waiting hear back from the team but it would be good to understand what other people who experienced something like that did next? I’m just trying to rationalise and not panic whilst I wait to hear what my team suggests next.

EDIT - thanks all. Sounds like there will be other options and I just need to try and keep my anxiety in check whilst I wait to hear what’s next. ",2024-01-28 18:48:12,CrohnsDisease,5,1ad9sb0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ad9sb0/infliximab_reaction_what_next/,2024-01-28

207,Humira,Anyone have first had experience with stem cell therapy (specifically MSCs) or exosomes? I'm getting desperate...,"I'll try to be brief. I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2015 after 6 months of bleeding and other issues. Zero family history of autoimmune issues, and zero medical issues prior. Over the course of 8 years I've been through most every treatment you can imagine. I've been on and off (mostly on) various dosages of Prednisone for a majority of that time. Long term use has definitely had serious repercussions. I've tried most of the biologics starting with Remicade, then Humira, Cimzia, Remicade again, and most recently Entyvio. Each had some effect, but over time they would always start fading out and the symptoms would return full force. Entyvio took the longest to take effect, with the least impact on symptoms during which I developed serious symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis, occasional psoriasis type symptoms. The arthritic symptoms have become more painful and unmanageable than the digestive issues. I currently (and for the last few years) have had major issues with perirectal abscesses, and fissures resulting in an examination under anesthesia where they placed 7 setons (about a year ago).

I had heard of stem cell therapies being promising in the early years of my diagnosis, but didn't do much reading into it. Over the past few years I've been much more heavily looking into stem cell therapies specifically MSCs and seeing how promising the research is for treatment. Around the new year (thanks to insurance changes) I finally tapered myself off Prednisone and stopped my Entyvio infusions. I've had a few rough days (especially the first couple days without Prednisone), but really not any worse than when I was on the meds. I've reached a point where I feel like I need to try stem cell therapy, or even MSC derived exosomes, which I've just recently learned about. Otherwise there's a very high chance of needing a colostomy which would likely require removing part or all of the rectum, which, from what I understand, would be irreversible.

Now my challenge has been trying to get the right information on what clinics do those types of therapy (and not just injury treatments) as well as the potency of their treatments, costs, etc. I'm starting to get overwhelmed at this point, which usually leads to me becoming withdrawn and not dealing with the issues until I end up in the hospital. So I'm really hopeful that others in here can give me first hand accounts of their experiences with treatments, efficacy, etc. as well as specific cell types and count, costs, etc.

I have an old co-worker who lives in Salt Lake City that has been in the industry for a few years, but I think she's some type of consultant/sales rep for a specific product because when I've asked her about info on certain treatments, she's always comparing to ""her product"" which she hasn't been able to get me with a clinic that uses ""her product"" making the whole point moot. When I talked to a local clinic today, they suggested an exosome treatment of 100 billion cells over two days, for $8,000. I told her about this and she said that's outrageously expensive and that ""her product"" for exosomes is 300 billion cells, and that a treatment with 100 billion exosome cells should be more like $4,500.  She also insisted that while she thinks exosomes could help, she said I'd be missing out on a lot of the regenerative properties and long term relief of actual MSCs.

My head is spinning and I'm open to any and all information.",2024-01-19 22:41:15,CrohnsDisease,7,19aw0vr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/19aw0vr/anyone_have_first_had_experience_with_stem_cell/,2024-01-19

My symptoms are similar to a flare, tired, loose/watery stools, weakness, bloating. It isn't like debilitating but I for sure just don't feel good everyday.  I stopped eating dairy and processed sugars for years now, but as of a week ago I stopped gluten too and I do feel a bit better but not 100%

Meeting with the doctor next week. Anyone have this happen to them?

I'm currently in between medications for crohn's but planning, at least prior to my test, to get on Humira.

214,Humira,Body not responding to any medication so far - Trying to see if anyone else experince it and got any recommendation. (From UC to Crohn),"Hope y'all doing well. 

I was initially diagnosed with UC back in 2013. In 2019 I went for IPAA surgery and now living with jpouch. During this time I tried so many different biological mediation (not all) such as Remicade (got allergic reaction), entyvio (didn't not response), humira (gave alot side effects and did not work for disease it self), xeljanz (did not work, gave side effects). Only thing that has worked for me time to time is one and only prednisone. But it gives me hell a side effects and once I stop..my IBD get worse. 

So moving forward to 2022 - end of 2022 I got complicated fistula and then I went for scope and doctor notice I got very bad inflammation in my pouch and 30cm above pouch. Doctor put me on stelara in January 2023 and I started feeling very good. Went on multiple trips and put about 22lb so far. Few weeks my GI did blood work and he notice that my iron was very low so he got concerned about it because either I am losing blood or my body isn't absorbing iron. He ran a stool test and notice blood so I went for endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. GI found ulcer in pouch, inflmation 50cm above pouch and jejunal ulcers and few other things that confirm I got crohn's. So now - I am told, I have been misdiagnosed and it was crohn's presenting as UC. So that sucks. 

So clearly Stelara isn't working but I am feeling good. I have no pain and I am maintaining weight. He believe it's not working. He said, subjectively I am doing good but objectively I am doing bad. He is planning to add either 6mp or Azathaioprine medication along with stelara and see how mu body response but it can take months to see result so for now he put me back on prednisone. urghh

Anyways, he said - I have failed many medications so far and there are some few more medications left to try but he is like some of them are very similar to others I have failed so he isn't sure if they will give any positive results. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**So questions are -**

1.   Have you or do you know anyone who may have been through similar experince. 
2.   Is anyone out there have tired same medication again that they failed in past? 
3.   If there are any other medication besides the one I mention in my list - you can share it with   
  me that worked for you. I can may be discuss that with my GI? 
4.  You think going to Cleveland or mayo clinic would give me different result in my health?

215,Humira,I’ll never learn…,"NEVER!!!

Christmas Day: A day that starts with a long hard look on the mirror and a little pep talk to my guts. 

Me: “We’ve been having a string of couple good days. Let’s not fuck it up, ok?”

Guts: Bbrrmble blup. 

Me: Alright. Here we go. 

What’s for dinner? Steak. Mashed potatoes with garlic and roasted broccoli. Broccoli? Really? Do you guys want to see me writhing on the floor rolling around and crying? What, we’re getting a dinner AND a show today, huh? That wasn’t on the playbill but ok. 

I have to make it? Why? “because it’s not as good when someone else makes it”

[sigh] Okay, I guess…

Deviled eggs (thank you everyone who stopped in yesterday and laughed at my “poop” on the floor and helpful hints) for appetizer. They were so good by the time I got around to taking pictures, only 6 were left. 

Broccoli: pan roasted in olive oil in super high heat, with garlic, salt and pepper, just enough to char the bits, a bit of balsamic vinaigrette and sesame seed oil at the least minute and give a quick toss. 

Mashed potatoes: milk butter, garlic chives, salt and pepper to taste. 

Steak: 16oz New York strip. Seared in butter and rosemary, butter spooned over the steak as it cooks. 3 minutes to a side, let it rest. 

I will not overeat. I will not overeat. I will not overeat. Will not overeat. Will not overeat. Will overeat. Will overeat. 

Overate. 

Death take me now. 

I’m so uncomfortable. I’m so bloated I can’t even breathe in fully. 

There’s only one position that I can lay in that makes the pain… how should I put this? 

Every position I lay in, my stomach does a drum solo as the bubbles travel from one strictured area from another, they’re like a bus full of tourists rushing around, gathering, ready to explode… blub blub blub, next section. 

The announcer on the tour bus: “If you look to your right, we’re not directly under the stomach, in the small intestine. As you can see, the stricture is blocking our passage and we need more gas to explode for us to move forward. Next stop, the ileum!”

Blub blub blub

So the cycle of pressure and release continues, the pain becomes excruciating until it bubbles and moves on to the next section. The cycle continues but if I lay on my right side, the frequency with which this cycle happens slows down a bit. So instead of wanting to die every minute and a half, I want to die every three to five minutes. I’ll take it. This is when I steal little bits of sleep anyway. 

Now the problem is, when I lay on my right side, I get terrible acid reflux. I get acid reflux ONLY when I’m laying on my right side. 

Me (to my stomach): c’mon man. Be cool. Pick a fucking lane. Either hurt me or give me acid reflux. Don’t do me dirty like this. It’s Christmas for fuck’s sake. If you’re gonna kill me, just fucking do it already. 

My stomach: Brrapapbrap blub blub? No. 

Me: No? C’mon… why not? 

My stomach: Fuck you, that’s why. Brrrablubpaarrreadf blub blub blub. Now you gotta go shit. 

Me: what? I just got comfortable here for like fifteen seconds…

Stomach: BRAAPBRAPAP!!!

Me [getting up]: okay okay… Jesus..

Stomach: FASTER

I hope you guys made better decisions than I did today. I’m going to be paying for this for the next three days at least. 

Though I think Humira might be lessening the pain a bit, though that could be psychosomatic. 

We’ll see.

216,Humira,Failing a Biologic,"Hey everyone!

Was confirmed and diagnosed with Crohn’s in my small intestine this last year in August.

I started biologics (Humira) in September once my doctor got the prior authorization completed. However, I’ve had extremely bad symptoms from consuming any food. Doctor sent me home with Dicyclomine 20mg; being taken with meals and at bedtime. This was after I tried Hyoscamine SL and was put into retention with my bladder with water, which ended up with me getting a catheter out in. 

So far, the dicyclomine 20mg four times a day has been the only thing allowing me to function whatsoever. Also having to stop eating after 6pm so I can sleep properly. Maybe get 2 hours a night if I’m lucky before now. Also taking gabapentin for pain, along with acetaminophen.

GI doctors said they usually consider a biologic failed after 6 months. 

What has been your timeline for being able to get switched onto another biologic? What meds/other things have helped manage between biologics with symptoms? 

Has anyone tried cox-2 only inhibitors instead of otc NSAIDs?",2023-12-23 02:22:53,CrohnsDisease,3,18ovdsm,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/18ovdsm/failing_a_biologic/,2023-12-23
217,Humira,More Effective or Safer Options than Humira?,"I was on Humira for about the past 10 years.  Still have symptoms of Crohn’s and Colitis (GI says i have “Crohn’s-Colitis”).  Pretty even keel 10 years until about the last six months.  My liver enzymes came back quite elevated on routine bloodwork.  Had them checked again and they can back down.  But i had a ultrasound of my liver and all was good except for the fact that it is enlarged.  GI said to not worry about that.  It can have a slight ache/tender to the touch when i push in that region which concerns me.  Might be a bit psycho-somatic though. 

Then 3-months later i get my first back of pretty severe abdomen shingles.  I stopped my Humira during this outbreak and haven’t been on it since.  Once the shingles resolved (a month) I have actually felt pretty good for the past three months not being on Humira.  I have continued to take my Lialda/mesalamine pills.  

I think i am at that point where i need to stop pretending i don’t have these auto immune diseases and get back on biologics.  But a bad case of shingles and potential PHN is enough to scare someone, and I’m wondering if Humira is hurting my liver as well. 

So, Reddit Crohn’s friends…just asking for your opinions and advice…time to get back on the meds?  Am i feeling ok because of residual effect of years on Humira and staying on my Lialda?  Ever worry about your liver while on biologics?  And biggest question…is there anything better than Humira out there these days?  I don’t care about the shot vs pill.  Shot is nbd to me.  By the way, i also have ankylosing spondylitis so Humira technically is a 2 for 1 drug for me….just didn’t appreciate the shingles and i don’t feel like it does a lot, at least symptoms wise.

218,Humira,Is Crohn’s progressive if untreated?,"Is it progressive even if treated? 

Is the goal of treatment (I.e. biological) purely to reduce symptoms? Or is it also to reduce your chances of colon cancer? 

I am struggling because I just got diagnosed with Crohn’s but feel like my symptoms are very manageable. I’m worried about going on long term treatment options like Humira because I’m worried the side effects and risks might be greater than the symptoms I’m dealing with. The one thing that would push me in the direction of taking them is if they would actually reduce chances of getting colon cancer and stop progression. I asked my doctor this but not sure if I got a good answer. 
 Any insight?

Edit: wow. Thank you all for sharing your stories. I’m quickly realizing this is not to be fucked around with. The diagnosis came quickly for me (and for that I am grateful) but because it was so quick, it was also so unexpected and left me (incorrectly) thinking that I’ve lived with these symptoms for the better part of a decade (I’m 30) at almost the same intensity, so can deal with them longer without medication.

220,Humira,Chronic pain / slow healing starting with humira,"Anyone have any experience like this? I started humira in August, and finally tapered off 6 months of Prednisone in September. Quickly got into remission and was good for like a month. 

Starting in end of October / early November, my body started feeling worse and worse by the week. I was just feeling sore and beat up, so I stopped working out (was previously working out 3 or so times a week).

My knees are to the point where I can't sit cross legged or one leg over the other anymore. My (already kinda shitty) plantar fascitis seems so much worse despite PT. I did some shoulder stretching 5 weeks ago and, while my PT thinks I did a stretch that I probably shouldn't have done, I'm still in pretty intense pain from my shoulder through my hand despite daily PT for my shoulders. 

It's like I'm getting injured from nothing and my body isn't healing. My GI is telling me it's not from prolonged steroid use or humira, since this seemed to have started a month or two after humira / Prednisone end. I was never like this before. PCP is perplexed and can't find anything in labs. Calprotectin blood test came back almost 0, so no inflammation markers there. Going to take months to get into rheumatologist or endocrinologist (which is where my PCP referred me to).

221,Humira,Help my life with Crohns feels like it is ending,"This is a stream of consciousness of my situation and I dont know what to do.

\- I smoke 3 joints a night. I have tried to stop but can't.

\- I am very busy with work and I don't have time to keep going to see doctors because its an hour drive each way. I'm also really bad at showing my emotions and being truthful. So I don't have painkillers often enough or strong enough from the rheumatologist because I fail to show how much I am suffering. So I buy a paracetemol codeine pills on the black market, and take as little as I can to take the pain away to sleep, only when needed. This turns out to be every day for around a month. Then my condition gets managed better so I stop. I have started doing the same with prednisone. I taught myself the dosages typically used for Crohns and the tapering strategies. This is because I have had trouble with my insurance approving Humira and I am appealing and its a long process, and all my GI does is occasionally give me a script for 1 week of prednisone. If I wasnt doing this I wouldnt be able to work. In my country there is no disability cover for the likes of this illness.

\- I have a bad relationship with my aging father. Whenever he messages me it triggers lots of anxiety and I use kratom to take it away. This happens once or twice a week.

\- I can't stop using the internet. I am afraid of moving forward in my life because I don't know what the next step is. I waste a lot of time at night watching lectures or comedy.

\- I drink lots of caffeine to try focus on work and fight the fatigue from my illness. Maybe three coffees and two redbulls some days. On good days where I dont need, it just 2 coffees a day. But that is only about half the time, so 3 days a week. My Crohns severity is the same with caffeine and without.

I am holding down a high paying job. I am too anxious to face disappointment from others. So my illness makes me fatigued and with all the doctors appointments I am often working on weekends and/or at night. I am exhausted, and sick of my job. I am a good performer so I get good reviews and pay increases.

I go to the gym 3 times a week and do 20 minuets of HIIT cardio. I dont have a routine. I just try to go when I can. Its unstructured.

My apartment is always in an absolute disaster. Every day I do wash some dishes but I never finish. So there is always dirty dishes. I clean my flat once a month. But I can only keep it clean slate tidy for a few days. In only 5 days it already looks like a warzone,

I have seen a therapist this year and she helped me with my childhood trauma. I was suicidal at the time. I also got diagnosed with high functioning level 1 autism this year.

I do not have any family. There is distant family but nobody talks to each other. For all intents and purposes there is Just my dad and I am always worrying about one day having to handle his funeral completely alone.

I had a good psychologist for a decade, but she is now so busy I can only see her once a month at best.

I am 35 and live in Africa and this country is not safe. I want to get out, because many of my friends have left, but I dont know if other companys will be as kind to me as my current one has. They have given me the flexibility to go to my medical appointments, and sleep off my fatigue and work from home. As long as the work is done in the end that is fine.. Although my job takes up all my time and I am stressed, I am too afraid that wherever I go may be worse. At least I have understanding from them and flexibility.

I moved an hour away from the city because it wasnt safe there. But I couldnt transition my medical providers to where I currently live. I did try but they didn't seem as good. So I drive to them several times a month, an hour away. I have to catch up the 3 hours I lose at work at nights or on the weekends.

I feel like I am just sitting in my apartment waiting for something to happen to me to fix all this or waiting to die. But that something I know wont happen. i have to act but I am stuck/frozen. Dont know what I am supposed to be doing or where I should go

I am not in therapy any more because I do not have the time, because of the fatigue from my illness making me unable to work some days and needing to catch up, or driving to appointments. So all this was too much because I didnt have time to get my work done and meet my deadlines. I have enough money saved where I would be fine on half the salary but I cannot find any part-time jobs advertised",2023-12-12 22:05:26,CrohnsDisease,12,18gxwq7,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/18gxwq7/help_my_life_with_crohns_feels_like_it_is_ending/,2023-12-12

It’s also been a month that he’s been coughing daily (without any other symptom), is it also something that happens under IS ? Or bc he’s more prone to infections could this be pneumonia or something like that?

223,Humira,So Sooo tired.,"I (28m) am writing this at 5am before I have to get up at 730am to go to work. I've been up since 3 with pain and can't find any position to get comfortable enough to sleep. For a little context I've been diagnosed with Crohn's since I was 18 but have probably had it since Early childhood. I have a perirectal fistula that doesn't really cause me problems anymore. 
Last year in October I had covid and I believe that did something to really jack up my Crohn's because it kicked off a chain of events. First was spending most of November under the weather and in pain. Humira stopped being effective and I spent 4 months trying to get on a different medication. Thankfully I was able to get on skyrizi. The infusion doses did wonders I felt great again but in June I started the self injection version of skyrizi and have gone down hill (I've told my new gi). Also in May. I spent a week in the hospital for an abscess in my stomach, right under my belly button. But the doctors just put me on tpn and antibiotics and didn't cut me open to drain it. A week after I got out I went to a different GI who had me go to a surgical specialist right away to have it looked at and had it cut up to start draining and healing. Well it turned into a more permanent fistula. 

This was all in May. Things were okay for a few months. On tpn and antibiotics. Healing a bit. Got off the antibiotics. The self injection skyrizi was working but not as good as the infusions were. 
I get to Sept and pain starts to kick up in my colon area on occasion. Bad enough I have to take a day off of work here and there. This trend continues till today but since this weekend the fistula area has been hurting non stop. I have an ostomy bag over it to catch the drainage. Every movement of my stomach is s pulling and tugging pain. I can't sleep on my sides because of the tugging pain. I can't sleep on my back because my colon gurgles hard enough to hurt. I can't sleep. I'm in pain. I cried for 30 minutes in frustration. Idk what to do. 

Sorry if this is out of order but I've seen my new GI (old one was a POS) twice since I've been out of the hospital and last in late September. She's been on the wait and let it heal train. I have an appointment in January with the gi and an appointment with the surgeon in December to go over corrective surgery for my fistula I believe. But idk how long till the actual surgery. 

I'm just typing this out because I'm tired. Frustrated in pain and just hate my life at the moment. This has been the worst year of my life thanks to crohns. Id rather have my removed than have another stomach fistula",2023-12-01 10:29:17,CrohnsDisease,12,1888owv,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1888owv/so_sooo_tired/,2023-12-01
224,Humira,Remicade/Entyvio/Humira....is Stelara next,"I've had crohns for nearly 20 years. Currently 35, I'd had over ten years success on Remicade, then that stopped working so we moved to Entyvio. After a stint in the hospital it was clear Entivio wasn't for me. Around May of this year switched to Humira, which never really seemed to work that well. I had a month or two I thought it was improving but after 6 months + on this medication and two MRI's that didn't show much improvement, I think its time for me to move on.  I've lost around 40 pounds since the start of the year between my Entivyio and Humira issues. I've had bad cramps severe nausea and vomiting, though not a blockage. I still to have BMs. 

Based on what I've talked to my doctor about it seems like Stelara would be the next medication to try. My doctor tends to favor medications that have been on the market longer like these rather than the new ones I hear about like Rinvoq Skyrizi etc. I'm wondering what others experiences have been either on Stelara or where they moved after Humira stopped working?

225,Humira,Humira not working?,"Hey all! I live in Madrid, Spain, and been diagnosed with Crohns two years ago. 
Started as a mild Crohns with some ocassional diarrhea (2-3 times a week), inflammation, a fistula and some random fever episodes. 3 months ago I started having regular stomach pain almost every day from 7pm til I go to sleep (yes, it’s mostly during that period of the day, weird?)
My GI tried first with Budesonide, then Prednisone, both seemed to work when on them but stopped working as I tappered off. Now I started Humira 5 weeks ago, 4 shots first time, then 2 shots two weeks after that and now one shot every two weeks. I’m very worried because I don’t notice even a small change since I started the treatment and I’m starting to loose hope. What are the chances it ends up working if it didn’t do anything after 5 weeks? Any success stories that can motivate me out there? 🥲

Thanks everyone.

All the best!!",2023-11-26 18:30:04,CrohnsDisease,2,184h7vd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/184h7vd/humira_not_working/,2023-11-26
226,Humira,Weed &amp; crohns,"I’ve been having a flare up since almost a year now. I’ve stopped Pentasa because I used to throw up whenever I wanted to take it (I was pregnant and highly nauseous) and I haven’t taken it since. I’m not even sure it used to help with my Crohn’s but my dr said it’s safer to take it to protect the lining of my bowels or whatever 

I smoke once a day at night. During the day I go to the bathroom around 4-5 times. After 8 (when I smoke) I stop having stomach cramps and stop going to the toilet no matter what I eat (huge salad or very spicy food) 

So basically weed is illegal in my country SO I’ve mentioned to my gastro dr that whenever I take a “Xanax” I feel all better and no more painful poopies or going to the toilet. He said Xanax doesn’t really help with flare ups and I’ve asked him about Librax to see maybe if I could take it since weed helps. As usual he asked me to do a blood test + stool sample and let me just say I am DONE and SO FED UP with blood tests and dropping my poop juice to the hospital every time I cannot be bothered I know for a fact there’s mucus and calprotectin is high in my poopies. 

I’m sick of hearing yes u have a flare up here’s some steroids. All I know for a fact is that weed helps every single time and every single day my only time off poopying is at night after I smoke. 

I know weed is a bandaid when it comes to these things so my question is am I crazy to think librax might help in my case or even getting a prescription for Xanax or something just ANYTHING for during the day? 

I’m so annoyed and fed up. For anyone wondering my crohns hasn’t got too bad for me to start immunosuppressants or maybe it is and I don’t know it yet but my dr hasn’t given me the go ahead to start Humira. So far it’s courses of steroids which I don’t even take when prescribed 

Also, I know other people with IBD/IBS whose symptoms go away after smoking so what’s the deal with that?

227,Humira,Starting stelara update - Anaphylaxis,"I made a post last night about starting stelara and got some kind and helpful comments that settled my nerves.

Unfortunately, I was just painfully unlucky and after only receiving 6ml of the drug I went into an immediate anaphylictic-like shock. Im not 100% sure it was an allergy thing as my nurse said it was more likely my immune system rejected the chemical bonds in the drug. 

I wasnt able to breathe but a nurse nearby was able to stop the reaction with a double shot of steroids and a high dose of antihistamines, and i went on oxygen for a little while. Thankfully I'm home safe and sound now. Its been *quite* the day. But I'm alive. 

My IBD nurse now wants me to come back in 2 weeks to try Entyvio and I'm honestly terrified and I don't want to. I know I didnt have any reaction to Humira or Remicade but now I feel like I cant trust my body anymore.

Has anyone here ever had this experience with Stelara, and if so, were you able to go on other meds like Entyvio?",2023-11-22 17:10:37,CrohnsDisease,4,181e6y9,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/181e6y9/starting_stelara_update_anaphylaxis/,2023-11-22
228,Humira,Humira Wear Off Vent/Question,"Hi, I’m 23M and have been having lots of flare up symptoms all year despite no conclusive evidence of active inflammation. Most recently for the past 2 months I’ve been feeling awful for the day-two days before my Humira shot which I already take once a week. I got approved to try Rinvoq but with the Holidays coming up I figured it best to finish my last Humira dose to get me through the traveling and family gatherings since I know I usually get at least a few days of feeling normal before the wear-off hits me. I woke up today with abdominal cramps so strong they interrupted my sleep at 5am, and a bowel movement that was so awful I felt like I was going to be pass out. 

Although I fully plan to start Rinvoq in a few days once I survive thanksgiving, just looking for some extra validation on my Humira wearing off theory. Has anyone had similar experiences when feeling like Humira has stopped working for them?  I had taken a blood test to see how much of the medicine is in the system right before doing my weekly shots and had 13ug/ML at the end of my dose. The threshold says 8ug/ML is needed to see treatment but considering my dosage is 40ug/ML once a week, my result seems fairly low and was just wondering if anyone had a similar level while feeling the Humira wear off.",2023-11-22 14:45:40,CrohnsDisease,5,181aq1u,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/181aq1u/humira_wear_off_ventquestion/,2023-11-22
229,Humira,Finally diagnosed,"Quick little history: Late 2021-early 2022 GI symptoms caused by endometriosis lead to acute terminal ileitis being found in a colonoscopy. Symptoms resurfaced April of this year and so I went straight to my local GI. Suspected ileocolonic crohn's, but biopsy results weren't specific enough for diagnosis. I got tired of waiting and decided to go to the Mayo Clinic. Got many blood tests, stool tests, an MR enterography, &amp; colonoscopy on Nov. 2nd &amp; 3rd. 


Well, I just had my virtual appt with a pharmacist in their IBD department today and they plan to start me on a biologic. Most likely Humira.

230,Humira,"Humira, then Stelara : no improvements. Can a change in diet be helpful ?","My boyfriend (34) was diagnosed with Crohn's at 18. He first tried corticoids with no effects, then Remicade and some years later, Humira. He was symptoms free for some time and had the bad idea to stop his treatment. A year ago, some symptoms (diarrhea, bellyaches, more than 5 bowel movements per day, weight loss) came back. He had a coloscopy that showed lesions but apparently it wasn't too bad. He tried Humira again, which led to some improvements (less pain, sometimes less bowel movements) but still not ideal. His gastroenterologist talked about trying a new treatment, Stelara. He had the first dose a month and a half ago, and there was zero improvements, it actually got a bit worse than before...

So his case isn't extremely severe, but still impacts his day to day life. He has to think about being not too far away from toilets or a place to hide, and the rectum lesions are painful.

The gastroenterologist never talked about diet or lifestyle changes. But I read/heard stories about people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis who changed their diets (generally towards anti-inflammatory, sugar-free and/or gluten-free diets) and it often greatly helped them. Some went into remission or with very mild symptoms. Some people still needed a strong medication, but they were symptoms-free only with the combination of medication and special diet.

Are there similar stories here ?",2023-11-15 20:07:59,CrohnsDisease,8,17w2f4l,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17w2f4l/humira_then_stelara_no_improvements_can_a_change/,2023-11-15
231,Humira,Just your typical poo related questions,"I've have Crohn's for almost 20 years, been on Humira for 9 and had my first resection in May (about 12cm). Pathology indicated the stricture was from scarring due to the Humira healing inflammation. I had my gallbladder removed in 2008. The last time I flared was 9 years ago which is what prompted the Humira. I have anemia and get iron infusions. I also seem to have some mast cell issues.

About 6 years ago I started experiencing chronic diarrhea with cramping. I've tried: a low FODMAP diet, Cholestyramine, Cromolyn Sodium, cut down on gluten, sugar and lactose, added more fiber and cut down on carbs, cutting out fiber and upping white carbs. I tested negative for celiac disease and a motility study came back normal.  Fiber definitely seems to increase the number of times I go diarrhea but cutting down on it just adds more constipation on top of the diarrhea. The resection was for a stricture that I probably had for at least those 6 years. The hope had been the diarrhea would stop after the stricture was removed but it hasn't. The positive is I haven't noticed any worsening since having my terminal ileum removed.

Some days I go between being constipated and diarrhea. I'll eat the same things multiple days and my bowel movements will be different every day. I've seen multiple Registed Dieticians and none of them could come up with anything new.

So my question is, is this just normal? The diarrhea started 2 years into my Humira and I don't understand why. Do I just need to accept that I'll never have a normal stool again? I hear of other people having normal bowel movements after getting their Crohn's into remission and I don't understand why the opposite has happened for me. Is anyone else experiencing something similar or has suggestions for how I can regulate my bowels?",2023-11-15 17:18:33,CrohnsDisease,4,17vyi9n,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17vyi9n/just_your_typical_poo_related_questions/,2023-11-15
232,Humira,Im tired of chrons disease,"Hi, I don’t post on reddit much, I don’t understand it fully, but I wanted a community to be able to vent about chrons disease to, people who can understand me. 
I am 21, got diagnosed officially when I was 17. These last 4 years have been hard on me.. especially coming to college away from home, minimal healthcare, and surrounded by people who don’t understand my health. With living on campus, people expect me to be able to hangout whenever, attend any event, eat whenever and not have to worry about a flare up. I am currently on Humira but it feels as though I’m not on any medications at all. My flare ups feel so intense to where I can’t move, make it to class or hang out. Its been difficult making friends and maintaining ng a friendship because when I’m asked to hang out I always have to bail last minute because se of yet another flare up. Lately I’ve been feeling very isolated.. when I bail, these friends are questioning the validity of my health and treat me as though I’m lying. Eventually they stop caring because its all just an act to them, and another excuse. I really just want ti feel like a normal girl enjoying her twenties. Partying during the weekend, going on lunch dates, staying up chilling wit people im comfortable around. I know one day it will get better, but for now I just feel frustrated ated and so alone in this.

233,Humira,Fun with Humira (vent),"Venting time:

I normally don't do my own injections because I don't do so well with things that poke and things that make big sudden noises. For a brief time when I did my own, I had to pop anti-anxiety meds, blast music in earbuds, and numb my skin completely to do it. Even though the ice hurts more.

Today I didn't have someone to do it. Nor did I have meds, but I thought it wouldn't be an issue. Ha. I gathered my stuff and calmly sat down in bed. After I numbed and disinfected the site, I opened up the two caps and started pinching my skin. I barely touched the business end to my skin before I started shaking and went into a panic attack (maybe?). Then I spent 30 minutes crying because I had already opened the cap and couldn't stop now, but every time I even thought about it I freaked out more. Tried refreshing myself with the training videos because the last self-injection wasted it all. It didn't help--it was even scary hearing the sound of the button in the video.

So anyways, I didn't do my injection, my (absolute saint of a) husband might have to drive 5 hours total to do it for me, and the perfectly good dose of Humira (that I fucking opened and didn't use) is sitting in a drawer. I want to use it but now I'm scared because it isn't sterile. But if I don't use it, I'm wasting a $2000 pen. I feel so much guilt and shame for not being able to just suck it up and do it. 

Does anyone else have the same thing? Where you feel mentally prepared, you know you have done it before... but then it all goes south in an instant?",2023-11-11 03:20:56,CrohnsDisease,1,17slmnk,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17slmnk/fun_with_humira_vent/,2023-11-11

235,Humira,Can we talk about Skyrizi and Humira for a moment?,"So I’m sure many of you have also seen the recent wave of Skyrizi commercials and it seems from browsing this subreddit that many are being recommended by their GIs to switch from Humira to Skyrizi.  Does anyone else see the correlation between the end of patent for Humira and this sudden boom in Skyrizi marketing?  This isn’t exactly a secret, but both Humira and Skyrizi are owned by the same company - Abbvie. 

Abbvie’s literal goal in bringing Skyrizi to market was to deal with Humira reaching end of patent.  Abbvie is at serious risk of losing its golden goose unless they transition folks from Humira to Skyrizi (they have an entire website dedicated to marketing the switch from Humira to Skyrizi).  I’m sure everyone here who’s taken Humira before is acutely aware of the insane revenue that Humira’s generated for Abbvie since inception. We’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars.  Now that they’re losing the patent they suddenly want to start pushing another biologic?? 

I don’t doubt that Skyrizi has helped some of you out there, but other than the cases where Humira stops working, I haven’t seen any evidence to support Skyrizi being genuinely a better biologic than Humira.  They both provide similar levels of effectiveness and both have similar risk profiles.  The only difference is that under Skyrizi Abbvie is able to lock folks into insane pricing for several more years.",2023-11-07 08:56:17,CrohnsDisease,11,17pq3gs,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17pq3gs/can_we_talk_about_skyrizi_and_humira_for_a_moment/,2023-11-07

- Diagnosed at 15 in 2015, turning 24 in a week
- Failed remicade, stelara, abrilada (humira similar), and entyvio. Started Skyrizi Oct.14th 2023
- In 2017 was hospitalized, had an imuran toxicity, had 8 blood transfusions.
- Am corticoresistant had 4-5 times 6 month long steroid rounds, no much help.
- Last scope was March 2023, and entero MRI was September 2023 : illness still active, in both intestines. Moderate to severe crohns disease. 
- Am currently in malnutrition/malabsorption and lost 10lb bc of active crohns. (Still at a healthy weight tho) Symptoms are intense cramping when eating and evening diarrhea anywhere between 2 and 20. 

Now I've had a fever last week up to 39.5 c° and intenseee lower back pain, and one again today same thing. I'm so worried, and I spiral. I got bloodwork done today, had a urine test too, and I have two bacteria stool test to do and a c diff stool test to to do. All will be done friday. So I know that if there's anything my GI will be on top of it. She's very thorough. But I keep getting anxious. Like what if I have c diff? What if I have cancer? What if I have renal failure? What if what if what if?

(My GI is an amazing woman I feel very very secure with, I trust her completely and feel at ease with her, I've told her about all my crazy concerns before and she keeps reassuring me, but for some reason I still spiral and google everything like ""fever + crohns, why?"", or ""crohns complication"" and then panic when i have many symptoms)

239,Humira,"Dupixent Has Helped with my EoE, Food Allergies, Anemia (Iron Deficiency), &amp; a Crohn's Misdiagnosis","Hello everyone, I had a breakthrough in my health this year (have never felt healthier in my entire life) and thought I'd share my story with others. I am a 26 year old male who's had asthma and issues with allergies his entire life (sinusitis). Here's my timeline.

* I had developed severe food allergies to corn, wheat, dairy, eggs, fruits, &amp; vegetables in 2019 (vomiting/pain at worst, bloating/discomfort at best), I was told I had leaky gut syndrome and needed to see a GI and a Hematologist because I was also severely anemic (iron deficiency).
* I began my elimination diet in 2019, and my diet had consisted exclusively of meat, rice, &amp; potatoes.
* In late 2019, I had an Upper Endoscopy that found eosinophils in my stomach and signs of gastritis. I held off on seeing my GI to focus on my anemia, but would eventually get another GI later.
* Through my hematologist, I have been getting iron infusions since 2020 every few months because my body would not absorb iron from food or pills. Every third month my ferritin and iron levels would be below 20 L &amp; the cycle would continue.
* In 2020 I was also *diagnosed* with Crohn's in the small intestine via Capsule Endoscopy with a new GI. I had inflammation and mucosa in my small intestine. I took Budesonide for a few months (didn't help) and then went on Pentasa up until Feb 2023. Pentasa helped decrease my Calprotectin levels from the original 421 H and fluctuated between 100s &amp; 200s, but never dropped to the normal range of below 50 H. We went with Pentasa because I was afraid of biologics and hoped the long game would work.
* In March 2021, I started lifting and exercising hoping it would improve my overall health. A couple days after starting I broke out in hives in my entire body and could not keep Benadryl down. It was bad enough to go to the hospital but no explanation could be found. Zyrtec helped alleviate it and the hives went away after a few days. I tried to workout again months later and had the same reaction after a couple of days of working out. It was only then that I discovered it was trigger from lifting. No doctors (even now) could explain why.
* By 2022 I was frustrated by the lack of progress. My cholesterol was bad because of my poor dieting. Exercise was difficult because I was afraid of hives and the anemia didn't help. I was super skinny and weighed 138 lbs at my worst (I'm a 5'11"" male that weighed 160 lbs when I was in high school). I sought a 2nd opinion from another GI.
* I was diagnosed with EoE in 2022 via Endoscopy. I wanted to start a Biologics medication to treat Crohn's by GI #3, but he wanted to see what was going on first through an upper endoscopy. This GI found eosinophils in my esophagus and needed to dilate it as well. It was mid-2022 when i began taking Flovent and omeprazole, on top of the Pentasa. Treating the EoE became the priority for this GI, and out of frustration I went back to GI #2 because I just wanted to heal my Crohn's. My reasoning was that I never had trouble swallowing or chest pains, my main issues of vomiting/gastritis would occur an hour after eating.
* GI #2 now learned about my EoE and he mentioned that it was a cause for concern. But he did allow me to get another capsule endoscopy to check my small intestine before starting a biologics like Humira. I had difficulty swallowing the capsule this time because of EoE lol. My small intestine looked the same as 2020.
* Only after this last capsule endoscopy, my doctor had an epiphany. I had eosinophils in my esophagus, in my stomach, in my bone marrow (got a bone marrow biopsy with hematologist around the same time) and he suspected the mucosa in my small intestine was a build up of them as well. My Absolute Eosinophils count has also always been high my entire life (doctors always wrote it off as environmental allergies). It was then he suggested Dupixent over Humira because he now believed I had an eosinophilic condition throughout as opposed to Crohn's. Dupixent had only just been approved to treat EoE (not anywhere else however), but my doctor had a hunch that it'd help everywhere else.
* In Feb 2023 I stopped taking Pentasa and began taking Dupixent once a week. I was scared and worried it wouldn't work. In only a few months, however, literally everything had improved. My iron levels were normal by the time I would've needed another iron infusion. My calprotectin was below 50 H.

Since I started Dupixent I have been exercising regularly and introducing more foods I could not keep down or that would bring me pain (Eggs, vegetables, fruits, &amp; corn) allowing me to gain more weight while also lowering my cholesterol dramatically. As of right now, I'm no longer getting iron infusions either and all my test are coming out normal. I still stay away from gluten &amp; dairy because these still give me gastritis. I also do not get seasonal/environmental allergies anymore (Absolute Eosinophil count is still high however). My doctor doesn't have a timeline of how long I'll be taking Dupixent, if I can get off of it eventually, or if my issues will return. There's still a lot of research yet to be made. I can say now, however, that I finally feel normal and at peace. I used to feel lonely in this journey but know there are others with similar problems.

No symptoms for over a year now. Not on any medication. But my gastro really wants me to go in biologics. 

Only blood; I’m assuming it’s from piles as it stops when I use OTC creams  (sorry if this is TMI). 

Is it really Crohn’s?

Thank you 😊",2023-10-20 17:35:56,CrohnsDisease,9,17cgu5r,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17cgu5r/do_i_really_have_crohns_if_my_ulcerations_are/,2023-10-20

244,Stelara,Stelara At Room Temp!,"Hi Crohniez,

My refrigerator unfortunately stopped working overnight, and I realized in the afternoon. I have a fridge thermometer that read 60 degrees. I keep my Stelara syringe in the back of the fridge in a thermos. My next date to take the med is late December.

I can't confirm whether the Stelara reached above the recommended 46F and for how long. The vial of medication looked normal, but I don't know if/when I would be able to tell it's spoiled.

I spoke to both a pharmacist (where I get the Stelara shipped from) and the manufacturer (Jansen) about it. The manufacturer recommends not taking the dose in late December and requesting a replacement due to user error. The pharmacist thought it was probably fine as long as the medication looked normal by the time I would take it -- worst case it would just be less effective.

I am conflicted. Even if I get a replacement dose, I would hate to waste medication that could still work. I am American and the hassles I've gone through to get each dose of medication could fill a book. Especially with current legislation, I feel every dose I can get counts. At the same time, I don't want to make my health worse and end up paying more for medical care in the future.

For now, I stuck the syringe in a fridge at a friend's place. I know you're not supposed to put it back in cold but I wasn't sure if the medication itself actually reached room temp.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have advice? TIA.

TL/DR: Stelara may have reached close to room temp, over a month before it's supposed to be taken. Should I risk taking it anyway?",2025-11-22 23:37:03,CrohnsDisease,3,1p47mt9,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1p47mt9/stelara_at_room_temp/,2025-11-22
245,Stelara,"Is this a Flare Up, a Complication or my Biologic No Longer Working?","So I'll start by saying I live in Japan and have had a very complicated past with medicines and procedures.

I'm currently on Stelara though was on Remicade when I lived in the States. Since I've moved to Japan I feel like none of my doctors take any of my symptoms seriously - when I complain of pain they just want to prescribe pain meds instead of getting at what's causing it.

Recently I've been getting severe sharp pains in my intestines along with more frequent defecation (6-8 times a day, and yes you can guess where I'm writing this from).

Well I went to my doctor because I noticed a trend recently where jt felt like my meds were wearing off faster than I could get my shot every 2 months.

He said it's impossible to increase the dose and I just have to deal with it. I come back in 2 weeks because it got so bad I had a severe pain episode in the car that scared my partner.

He goes, ""Crohns flare up can't cause pain, so it's probably complications from your past surgery."" Though my surgery (resection) was 3 years ago and I hadn't had pain since then.

He says my blood also was temporarily high (0.50 c-reactin) but went back down to 0.29 which is my old baseline as of this last test 

He says, ""Your blood is happy so you shouldn't have any symptoms, come back in 2 months for your next shot.""

I walked out defeated and depressed. He did give me a stop-gap steroid to only take for a month if my symptoms dont get better within a week since my shot.

I'm just at a loss. I can't tell if I'm being gaslit or if it's in my head and I'm just making it worse somehow than it actually is.

Can someone at least try to make sense of what's going on with me? He did show me that my c reactive protein is back to baseline though I still thought 0.29 was still high.

As for the rest of my blood results they were also all fine too. He said they did a Japanese specific test for inflammation and he said it came back negative for inflammation too.

As for my surgery, I had a partial bowel resection (3-4 inches of small, 3-4 inches of large, my appendix and illeocecal valve) all in one go. I've taken some form of a biological drug since 2021 when I was officially diagnosed (though I had symptoms since I was in high school).",2025-11-17 09:55:47,CrohnsDisease,7,1ozcblx,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ozcblx/is_this_a_flare_up_a_complication_or_my_biologic/,2025-11-17

247,Stelara,Trouble with biosimilar insurance coverage,"Hello, 
I’ve been on Stelara for about 8 years and have been in remission for the past 2 years. My Crohns was debilitating before Stelara and I feel so lucky to have access to it. 

However now that the biosimilars have hit the market my insurance will no longer cover Stelara. I got automatically bumped to Wezlana by my insurance. I had come to terms with this but, when I called to fill the Rx with Optum, they let me know that my insurance covered $30 and the co pay assistance card covered roughly $4,000 leaving me with $480 left to pay!!! 
I already pay almost $900 a month as my insurance premium and can’t understand how anyone could afford this (I definitely can’t). When I called my insurance company to see if there were any biosimilars that they would cover, they said that they are all considered tier 2 drugs and would have the same issue. 

I tried getting a sample from my dr. But they let me know they no longer have them since the manufacturers stopped distributing them or something…. I’m just trying to get my medication I don’t want to have active crohns again…. It’s really disappointing and it’s really hard for me not to get overwhelmed after spending hours on the phone with insurance / pharmacy / manufacture / dr….. 

Anyone find a good way to get through all these hoops? 

Not for nothing but the woman on the insurance line suggested I go to my church and ask for the assistance in paying the co pay…. I’m sorry but is this really the world we live in now? Charity is now the default suggestion for necessary medical care??

254,Stelara,Damn this disease - keeps coming at me.,"TLDR: the punches keep coming with this flare-up, and now I’m dealing with a bag on my stomach due to a fistula filling my abdominal cavity with intestine juice. Just a rant about soldiering on and needing community to push through the difficult moments. 

I wrote a little while back about a gastric rupture that scared the living hell out of me, showing me a dark side of this CD. I’ve been in a flare-up for over a year, and I had stricturplasty surgery about 6 weeks ago to fix some damage. That unfortunately led to a gastric rupture about 4 weeks ago that made me lose half my blood - and now?! A new hole in my gut that’s been leaking waste from my large intestine into my abdominal cavity! I mean, c’mon! 

I noticed about five days ago the bottom of my incision scar from surgery was particularly tender. I was feeling like maybe now that I’m moving around more things were being pulled and the scar tissue stressed. It’s gotten more and more tender as the week went on to the point that it woke me up last night with searing pain, a pressure that emanated across the bottom of the belly. Up until today, visually it looked fine. 

I awoke this morning to find it had swollen a bit, and there were red markings all around the staple scars. I messaged my surgeon’s team, who asked about fever, chills, fluid under the skin - none of which I had.  Or so I thought. I was going about my day helping with some family stuff, in incredible pain just moving about, then it happened. I lifted my shirt to check it out again and it ruptured. I won’t go into the juicy details, but I knew something was very wrong because I could smell/see my gut contents. 

So, off to the hospital again, back with the nurse who said we need to stop meeting like this 😂 but I’m so grateful that I have consistency in these emergencies now with doctors and nurses who know the situation. 

Truth is though, I’m scared. This disease keeps taking new heads, like a hydra. Cut one off and another new and different one pops up. Because I’m still in an active flare-up this whole summer, I’ve been on a heavy dose of prednisone, which I’m told will keep the fistula from closing. Surgery is the last option, likely to cause more damage than good, so they are discussing a temporary one. This hole in my lower belly is over an inch wide and leaking bile into a bag, and all I can think is “no beach vacations in the near future”.

But I am trying to reorient my thinking here. I get a solution to an otherwise difficult, if not deadly, problem. I have great minds working with me to come up with the best solution to get me back to my life. I feel I have lost the last four months completely to this disease, not to mention the year of flare-up that I’ve been in while trying to find a new biotherapeutic that worked as great as Remicade did for me. 

I’ve started Skyrizi last week after failed attempts at Stelara and Rinvoq. I know there is no one size fits all, but I’m praying for some relief from these flare-up complications. Not many people know what it is to try and soldier in the face of chronic pain. I’m just so tired. Literally. Anemia, not eating enough, not absorbing enough. So I need a community around me to help keep my head above water. I know having people who just understand the grind that it takes to find your way back to remission isn’t impossible, but it is a journey that I don’t wish on my enemies.

258,Stelara,Crohn’s flare due to cancer treatment?,"I was diagnosed in 2017, started stelara in 2019, had about 3 years without symptoms from late 2020 until late summer of 2023 when I had a flare up of proctitis which is how it usually manifests when it flares. (Urgent need to go, mucus-y and sometimes bloody BMs) Usually a 40mg taper of prednisone and canasa suppositories clear it up. I flared again late spring of 2024. Then last December I was diagnosed with HPV+ throat cancer. Did 35 radiations, 6 chemos. As of June my scans are clear, bloodwork came back clean, seems like I’m in remission. But about 2 weeks before those scans I started to have another proctitis flare. Started the suppositories cause I had some on hand from last summer, hesitated on the steroids because I was fresh off cancer treatment and worried about complications. When I got the all clear my GI (who I’ve since left because he’s the third GI I’ve been handed off to at that practice, first guy left, second guy retired, never got a notification for either and it ended up costing me a 2 week delay in stelara treatment last year because I had to see this guy for prior authorization renewal) anyway we started on 20, it didn’t work, new GI said go up to 40, stop suppository because it had been about 6 weeks, and start tapering. At the time of that appt I had a couple days without any blood but after two days of no suppository the blood returned. I have a colonoscopy scheduled for two weeks from Monday. I’ve had blood on the toilet paper at least once per day for weeks, tho it does seem to be improving finally, I’ve started tapering the steroids but have gone back to the suppository. Just had blood drawn today to check stelara levels and other things before my next injection (tomorrow). Anyway, I recognize I’ve been lucky in some ways at least in regards to Crohn’s, it’s been mild, mostly controlled, a proctitis flare once per year isn’t the worst thing in the world. But after going through what I went through physically mentally and emotionally with the throat cancer I’m so scared about what this colonoscopy is going to reveal. My confidence in my health has been completely destroyed. I’m holding out hope that best case scenario this is just my body dealing with the poison I had to take to kill the cancer, and that my recovery from these things isn’t going to look like it used to because of what I’ve been through. Or maybe it’s just a hemorrhoid or something because most of my BMs now are solid and there’s just a little bit of blood on the toilet paper, the urgency is there but the frequency isn’t as bad as it’s been in the past, I’ve had flares where I’ve had to go as soon as I eat, now it seems I have to go a couple times in the morning and then maybe at night before bed. It’s just such a bummer because everyone was so happy for me when we got those clean cancer scans and I wanted to celebrate and be as happy as I should, and I was happy of course, but I couldn’t enjoy it like I should have because of this stupid Crohn’s. I’m hoping this new GI can help me figure this thing out once and for all, provided it’s not something worse.

I’m deficient in three kinds of vitamins, have two kinds of anemia, am going to the bathroom 10+ times a day, have a mouth full of ulcers, and just have so much abdominal pain. 

I was on Stelara and Rinvoq previously, but they stopped working well a year ago. My previous doctor kept increasing their doses instead of looking into alternate meds, which needless to say did not work. I came off Stelara and Rinvoq last week and now I feel worse than ever. I’m hoping it’s just temporary and that soon the Skyrizi will start working. 

I’m really worried about telling my doctor about my worsening symptoms because she’s said if things keep getting worse, she’s going to put me on prednisone. The thing is, I CANNOT go on prednisone. It gives me suicidal ideation and I’m already in a bad place, I know that I’ll have a mental crisis if I have to take it. I just don’t know what to do.

283,Stelara,Flare medication guidance,"Hi all,

First of all, I know I'm not asking the opinion of doctors here, but it's a Friday night, so you're the best I've got until Monday rolls around.

I'm due to start Stelara in 6 weeks, I just need to finish my TB treatment first. I'm currently on 9mg of budesonide to control my Crohn's, and it's always been pretty good at it. A few months ago, my GI gave me an emergency dose of Prednisone in case I have a bad flare. It's a weeks worth of 40mg a day that has been sat in the emergency box.

I was diagnosed in August 2024, and this is the first real flare I've had. My Crohn's has always felt mild, and it only ever hurt if I poked my ileum. However, it's been 4 days of twisting bowel pain, nausea (no vomiting), zero appetite, frequent toilet visits (red poo), massive fatigue, acid reflux, etc.

I feel a bit better today pain wise, but I'm not convinced it's going to go away just yet. So, my questions are:

- If I take the prednisone for a week, should I stop the budesonide? In my mind it seems like an either/or situation.
- Is a 1 week dose long enough to get the nasty side effects? I've never taken it before, but I'm aware it's not supposed to be pleasant.

I was hoping it would just go away on it's own to be honest, and that it was probably caused by something I ate last week. I wasn't even considering the prednisone, but I'm starting to get sick of feeling this way!

My Drs office tells me it's ""fine"" and I'm ok, my inflammation levels are good, my stool test didn't have any irregularities, blood work was clear,  and this is just my IBS causing issues, and to just keep taking laxatives, but isn't the point of being on stelara to NOT HAVE TO RUN TO THE BATHROOM MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY? because that's what the ibsrela does to me, so I don't take it until the pain from not going for so long hurts too much. And then it's right back to 20 bathroom trips a day... This ain't a way of living.... I am starting to regret ever going on stelara, and that's if it's even that medications fault, maybe this is just another Crohn's thing? My next Gastro Dr apt is Feb 3rd, what can I say or do to make them understand this is an issue and I am not fine?...",2025-01-25 02:45:16,CrohnsDisease,1,1i9d720,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1i9d720/stelara_ibsrela_and_wtf/,2025-01-25
291,Stelara,Long history of Crohns permanent ileyostomy in June 20 2024  28 year old male my life feel so empty and lonely. I'm far behind peers and just feel like I never got to develop as a person.,I've suffered from Crohns disease my whole life diagnosed at 5 had two bags shortly after up until high school.Got on remicade which worked wonders for me for about 13 years.Up until 2020 things took a turn for the worst. I had to have a surgery unrelated to my crohns which was a spinal fusion to fix my severe scoliosis. I had to stop treatment. Before and after surgery then ran into insurance and booking problems by the time I was able to continue it. Shortly after my surgery I started flaring having severe perianal disease had setons in for a long time tried stelara didn't work was suppose to try rinvoq which I couldn't because the bacteria from my gut traveled to the my tailbone causing osteomyelitis which had to be treated with antibiotics. Months of just staying home doing antibiotics through a piccline for months.For me to do the antibiotics I had to get a temporary bag first so the infection wouldn't keep feeding through my intestine. Doctors intent was to make it permanent due to my severe perianl fistula that were not healing and spreading.Now I have a permanent one and feel like my life is just a big fucked up game. I feel better physically but it like all the physical pain I had transfered mentally and emotionally. I have a billion other problems with health like teeth problems that also make me feel the lowest a person can feel. I'm 28 and life has past me by I never had a girlfriend never had a car just got my permit a few months ago never went to a prom have one person I consider a friend that I known since elementary school.

293,Stelara,Hospitalised for the first time in ~14 years and feeling very much like I’ve over exaggerated.,"Idk what this post is trying to achieve, mostly I’m just bored

I took a trip to the priority care centre near on Friday after work because I’d had some gut pain for a couple days which is super abnormal for me (even when I’m technically flaring!) and the doctor hears I have Crohn’s and sends me straight to the ER—which I had half expected, but mostly just wanted her to tell me I had gas

48 hours later I’m chilling in a bed, had one convo with the on-call colorectal surgeon (because it’s the weekend!) and it’s probably just a flare. Very happy the CT scan showed no blockage, and the bloods show no infection, but if I’d just waited until Monday I could have called my gastroenterologist and made an appointment. I did purposely go to the hospital with my specialist, so at least I’ll be able to talk to him tomorrow and see what happens next

Also like wondering how much of stuff I’ve overlooked for the past month has been flare stuff and not just… something like food poisoning as I’d imagined. My disease is by all means on the moderate side of things, but this is maybe a sign to stop just assuming things (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting) are something other than the Crohn’s. Especially because my scope in September showed signs of inflammation (we increased my Stelara to every 4 weeks after only having just brought it back to every 8)

294,Stelara,When should I give up on a drug?,"I’ve seen this kind of post a few times so apologies for its repetitiveness.

I started Stelara back in 19th August last year. I’m due for my 3rd injection on 3rd February. The problem is that I don’t think it’s worked in the slightest. I do know however that Stelara can take a long time to work, so I don’t know whether to hold out a little longer.

I’ve had a Crohn’s diagnosis for nearly 10 years now. I was initially on a Azathioprine and Infliximab combo, until I had to postpone Azathioprine due to neutropenia. They wanted to put me back on it, but I declined. So I just stuck with infliximab, and fortunately that worked for about 8 ish years. I relapsed however back in 2023, and came off infliximab completely in February 2024. I then started Rinvoq, which I failed in July. I’ve been on Stelara ever since, which I have not seen a single improvement for. 

I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow and I know he will stop giving me Stelara if it has not yielded any improvement. But I know he wants to try Azathioprine again if I fail Stelara, which I really would rather not as I’m not particularly fond of aza. I’m quickly running out of options. So, is there still hope of Stelara working, or should I just accept it as a fail?

298,Stelara,Skin Issues due to Biologicals,"Update from 02/05/2025 below

Hey! I‘m a 24 year old female from Germany (pls don‘t mind any grammar mistakes or how I call my meds)

I‘ve been on Infliximab for around 8 months but two months ago I started developing rashes which seem like a pustulous form of psoriasis down my groin and under my arms and eczema on my head.

It‘s been going really well for my colon, however I feel started remission before going on biologicals so I wouldn‘t mind getting off Infliximab or changing the med.

Today, I visited my doctor or at least her substitute who couldnt really tell me to stop taking it as she didn‘t want to interfere with my medication but she did tell me about the around 5% of people who develop psoriasis under TNF blockers.

Naturally I wonder if anyone one you experienced similar side effects and whether you could help with it or if it even goes away after getting rid of said medicine.

My normal doctor prescribed an oral prednisone, only 20mg which I have to take for around a week, this already helps tremendously, especially in combination with me using an urea lotion for my spots.

But I really wouldn‘t like to use prednisone as much, I love this med because it saved me from a lot of trouble but I am sadly aware of the side effects.

Maybe anyone can relate to any of this, will update once my normal GI is back on January 6th :)

Update 02/05/2025 

I visited a dermatologist in January but he didn‘t help as well, so I tried to figure it out myself. 

My patches got more red every time I injected my meds, so I talked to my doctor again and we‘ll switch from Infliximab to Stelara (Ustekinumab) in a few weeks. 

I‘m still not off the oral prednisone since it‘s the only thing helping, even though I have prescription prednisone lotions etc. It‘s now clearing up! 

The spots under my arms are fully gone, only the part between my legs is very stubborn. 

Urea and Panthenol are my holy grails, as well as baby oil to preserve the moisture. 

For my head, I just got a ketoconazole shampoo from the pharmacy, as well as doing weekly jojoba and rosemary oil masks on my hair and scalp. 

Maybe this helps you while waiting for an appointment!",2024-12-30 11:40:11,CrohnsDisease,7,1hplggy,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hplggy/skin_issues_due_to_biologicals/,2024-12-30
301,Stelara,Smoking weed with Crohn’s ,"
I was curious if anyone who stopped smoking weed with Crohn’s disease had any improvements in disease progression? Or even Remission. My Crohn’s doctor said that smoking makes Crohn’s disease worse but didn’t really specify Cigarettes or Marijuana. I was a long time Daly weed smoker and stopped for metal health reasons. I was smoking so much it was effecting my thinking, mood and sleep. Long story short my Crohn’s has been in remission for 7 years. I got my dad to start smoking weed to get off Alcohol. Trading one addiction for another and I thought it would be better on his Crohn’s . He did stop drinking but has been smoking weed all day for 14 years. He uses Stelara and has had a little bit of reduction in diarrhea. Anyway do you think if he stopped smoking weee his Crohn’s would go away ? Just brainstorming some ideas.

302,Stelara,Recently diagnosed with CD in left colon,"During my colonoscopy my GI saw a few spots of inflammation in my left colon and diagnosed me with Crohn's. I am fortunate that there is nothing more than this inflammation as I have been struggling with CD related symptoms for the past few years (mainly frequent trips to the bathroom, mucus in stool).

  
I have noticed whenever I smoke or vape weed, that my symptoms are way worse the next day. I stopped smoking/vaping a little over a year ago as a result of this. I recently did a month course of Prednisone which has got my symptoms under control and I will be starting Stelara soon.

I know we are all different, but I was curious if anyone else has a similar diagnosis with inflammation in their left colon/descending colon. My prognosis seems good but I am still concerned about what will happen once I am in remission and start to try expanding my diet. If I have a flare up will I need to find a new medication?

(just got my first fistula.) i got good doctors, right now i’m on prednisone and got my first dose of stelara 5 weeks ago.

my problem right now are my eating habits. nearly everything hurts right now but i know what is best for me to eat : rice, potatoes, fish, steamed vegetables, you know the stuff. i cook bone broth, i drink water and herbal teas. i know how to eat right in a flare.

the thing is i LOVE eating and it’s my ultimate source of emotional comfort. staying away from my comfort foods feels like withdrawal. (i do have a bit of an eating disorder history, but nothing too bad.) some days i can’t stop thinking about pizza, cheese and stuff like that. and although i haven’t had pizza in months i eat other stuff i KNOW is not good for me every other day. it feels impossible not to. 

now please don’t just write „just don’t eat it“. i would love to hear how you deal with the sadness of being cut off of your favorite foods and how you manage to eat healthy in a flare.

thank you guys so much! have a good and painless day!

307,Stelara,Crohns and bizarre symptoms ,"Hi All,

I really don’t have another way or form of venting to anyone as I’m isolated from family and friends- nobody seems to understand the difficulty involved in crohns and by far one of the most overlooked condition.

Long story short I’m 25 M diagnosed with crohns at 20 took prednisone and immuran, it got to the extent where I was about to require a bowl resection however stelara has been a saving miracle. Now where does it leave us today. 

Recently I’ve had none of the “typical” crohns symptoms, no abdominal pain, nothing except for two nerv wracking 4 symptoms. 

Symptom 1- unintentional weight loss-I’ve lost around 11 kg in 6 months without trying however I must say my diet has slightly changed  as now I don’t eat at all during the day but at night maybe 5pm I have a big dinner not purposly intermittently fasting but yeh you get the gist I may be on a calorie deficient due to a change of work routine.

Symptom 2- CONSTIPATION, one of the most bizzare symptoms is my constipation it’s actually very bad when I dose on stelara for maybe 3 weeks and then my stool begins to soften up. When I say constipation I don’t mean that hard poop, I mean that hard jagged poop that feel as if someone is sticking a knife in your rectum- it’s actually gotten to the point where I would sit like a frog on the toilet and do a push- that’s how much it would hurt- it’s always accompanied by blood I’m sure it’s tearing at my colon. Now the blood stops when my stool starts to loosen up I no longer see this. Mind you I don’t have any crohns “typical symptoms”(abdominal pain) while this is happening. 

Symptom 3-as mentioned in symptom 2 it’s the blood. It’s bright red blood my stool frequently changes from soft to hard although recently it’s been more hard than soft. Which may/may not be the reason for the blood.

Symptom 4 is foamy urine- I don’t even want to start on the amount if tests I’ve done to see why this is the case- still no answer- no protein in urine and everything come back normal.

I’ve obviously surfed “google” and according them it’s t minus 1 sec till my death. I’m very nervous- I’ve got a colonoscopy booked tomorrow- the prep taste like absolute shit and is the worst I can hear my stomach making some funny noises- I’m so very sorry.

I would like to know if anyone has some words of advise or is anyone experiencing the same strange symptoms m- I would like to say that I’m in an extremly stressful environment. Any help is help and id love done food for thought 

P.S I’ll never search google again …

My doctor told me yesterday to start with Rinvoq. I just looked at the side effect and they scare me a lot especially frequent slin cancer (1/10) and very severe acnea.

312,Stelara,Symptoms in remission,"I have had Crohn’s since I was 5 and I’m 26 now. I have taken many different medications. I was on stelara for 3 years before it stopped working. I was never in remission on stelara but I felt better than ever. I had no symptoms for the first time in my life, I could do anything and eat anything. In October 2023 I got a colonoscopy to check my progress and to my surprise my doctor said my Crohn’s was getting a lot worse. I was still feeling amazing and was really nervous to switch to a new medication plan. My doctor said it was necessary and I trusted her so in March I started RINVOQ. I did 45mg then went to 15mg. I started getting a lot of side effects, acne, weight gain, fatigue, and extreme pain that made me have to stop working. My doctor checked all my levels and everything was more normal than ever. My doctor did a colonoscopy yesterday and after he said that I was in complete remission. I just don’t understand why I have been out of remission for years and I haven’t felt even close to as bad as I do now while in remission. It is so frustrating. I am a park ranger, I train in rock climbing, I travel a lot internationally, and have my own woodworking business.

315,Stelara,Biologics causing heart failure?,"Hi friends, sorry for the long story... I've been on biologics for 10+ years (Remicade, Entyvio, Stelara, and now Skyrizi). Last fall, I went to my primary for what I thought was bronchitis/an upper respiratory bug...but it turned out to be congestive heart failure! There isn't a history of CHF in my family, and besides Crohn's, I'm a healthy 40yo female, so this diagnosis literally came out of the blue. 

After doing some research, I found that Stelara can cause sudden onset cardiac events, so I stopped taking it. And as of this May, my heart function was back to normal! However being off of Crohn's meds threw me into a super-flare, and long story short, I'm now on Skyrizi. I just had my third loading dose, and my heart failure symptoms have suddenly returned. At this point, I'm convinced biologics are messing with my heart. 

I'm following up with my cardiologist and gastro as we speak. Still, I'm curious if anyone else has had this reaction to biologics? And if so, what did you do? I'm due for my first Skyrizi injection next month, but I no longer want take it. However, if I forgo biologics, I don't know what I can do to help keep my Crohn's in check.

320,Stelara,Not sure how worried to be?,"So I’m missing work today, yet again, due to feeling too unwell to make it through the day. By far the biggest barriers to work for me on days like this are chronic fatigue, constant nausea with occasional vomiting.. and will throw up either foam or in some cases, undigested food from the night before. I have no interest in food but feel weak and like I need to eat, and just this general sense of anxiety, malaise, tightness in my abdomen, neck and shoulder pain, and sometimes low grade dissociation, like I’m seasick and disoriented.

I’ve had some very good days here and there and there has been a noticeable improvement to my stools, generally speaking.

323,Stelara,Looking for real world lived experiences on Stelara...my dr.'s are no good at communicating.,"So as the title says, I'm (39 M) looking for some positive lived experiences on Stelara.  I have had Crohn's since 2008, all in all, it's been rather mild.  The only real effect that it's had on me all these years has been using the bathroom more.  So after going on some meds initially, that didn't have much effect, and pretty terrible insurance, I've spent the last 13+ years just living with it med free and using the bathroom a bit more. It hasn't stopped me from doing anything. I've done long bicycle trips, my wife and I have gone on all sorts of vacations, and have never let it stop us from anything.  It's just been a part of life.  In the latter part of 2023 I went in to my GP for a physical thinking that I'm almost 40, so I should probably set a sort of baseline of my health...hadn't seen a doc since 2013 before that.  After some discussion about it, and having a colonoscopy, there was a recommendation that I start on a med (Stelara) to control things a bit more. Which I agreed to, and am on now.  
  
That's where some communication troubles started.  I've been trying to explain to my gastro that the way they are talking about things with constant reminders and warnings about me being ""immunocompromised"" while on this, and recommending that I stay away from people who are ill, always washing my hands, and clean surfaces before touching them, and stay 5 ft away from people, it is making me feel like they want to restrict my life, and it's feeding my wife's anxiety making it lots worse, and putting her on edge all the time, and giving us the indication that it's best that we never go and do anything anymore.  
  
For example...We had tickets to go see the olympic gymnastics trials in Minneapolis, and I asked them directly that it was ok to go to an arena full of people, and what I got back was paragraphs of warnings and reminders about being immunocompromised and stay away from ill people, and then buried in there was a single line about there being no medical reason why I couldn't go. But weighing how much time they spent talking about each, it seemed like they hoped I wouldn't catch that, and make the choice not to go.  
  
For some background...I can't remember the last time I was sick with some sort of upper respiratory cold. I work in an office for my county. My wife works at an elementary school, and picks up a few colds here and there, but that's it.  Heck...neither of us have had Covid...and that's with her teaching young kids and all that that entails. With all the communication from them, like I said...it's feeding anxieties, and is making my wife feel that she needs to quit her job because she is constantly around sick kids during the school year. It's unavoidable, and she's terrified that she will bring something home to me, so she's feeling like they want her to quit her job.  Secondly, when she feels like she may be the slightest bit ill, that she has to stay away from me. Her anxiety is telling her that she needs to move to a hotel or our basement until she's better. That is just some of the feelings that their communications have caused.  
  
I've been directly telling them how their words have made us feel, and have been asking them for some positive communications, and reassurance that things aren't as dire as their words make it seem.  I get the feeling that they think they are helping, but with the way they are saying things it makes us feel that in order to be on this med that they want us to give up our entire lives and hobbies, and stay home away from everyone.  All of this has caused my wife some adverse health effects. I feel like the stress has caused her to be ill from time to time, and she now has a therapist to work through her anxiety.  
  
From what I've read on Stelara, the doctors words don't match with the studies I've read.  
  
TL;DR of all of this...

I'm looking to calm some anxieties, and get some real life experiences. If you're on Stelara, do you have an restrictions on what you can, and can't do as it seems like my dr's are making it appear to be?  
  
P.S. I posted something about this when I was initially starting, and the result ended up with comments about my wife's reactions. I deleted that post...I would really appreciate it if responses kept anything like that out of them.

My insurance is going to stop covering Sterala, which has been helping me manage my disease immensely, and I was wondering if anyone has any experiences they could share with switching.

Thanks!",2024-07-07 14:15:33,CrohnsDisease,2,1dxhifd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dxhifd/experience_with_biosimilars_to_stelara/,2024-07-07

I just had my first infusion 2 days ago and the side effects seem to be more intense than when I was on Stelara or Remicade. The fatigue and lack of energy is really intense and I am feeling just generally weak. I am also having abdominal pain and a bit of nausea. 

What kind of side effects have you had from Skyrizi? Did it get better as you got more doses? ",2024-07-05 22:28:28,CrohnsDisease,4,1dwac7e,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dwac7e/skyrizi_side_effects/,2024-07-05

327,Stelara,Pain Management Doctor,Has anyone went to a pain management doctor for pain? I’ve had crohn’s for 5 years now and remicade just stopped working for me. I am back on steroids and started stelara 3 months ago. It doesn’t seem to be working. I am constantly in pain. My intestines feel like they’re on fire 24/7. My abdomen hurts all day and all night. I go to my GI every 3 weeks to express my frustration and we’re hanging in there because “Stelara takes almost 6 months to really work” I am waiting for that.. in the mean while he tells me if I am in pain and symptoms increase go to the ER. Which I do and they give my IV pain meds and a high dose of steroids and send me on my way.. I also get a prescription for pain meds to take home which last me 2 weeks. Those 2 weeks I feel normal thanks to the meds which suck because I don’t want to have to take pain pills to feel “ok” and live again. At this point I don’t know what to do. I read online that crohn’s patients can seek pain management from a PM doctor but I don’t want to rely on pain pills but what else can they do for me that my GI can’t?,2024-06-06 03:06:40,CrohnsDisease,3,1d98dvr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d98dvr/pain_management_doctor/,2024-06-06
328,Stelara,Who am I without this?,"I think I've lost my mind or am dealing with something mental. 

I've had this disease for nearly 20 years, moderate to severe left sided crohns. I've been in a flare for 14 months. I've been on everything except Rinvoq. Currently on Stelara but I don't think it's working. 

This flare has been horrible. Pain has been constant. Yet, I'm not bad enough for anything else to be done. Labs are all fine except calprotectin which was 1400 at last check in March. 

We've done several rounds of prednisone and budesonide, but I haven't responded at all to it. 

My GI started me on mesalamine enemas a week ago. I've gone from 20 bathroom trips down to 12 and I'm slightly panicking and I don't know why. I should be celebrating that something is finally working.

I've been flaring for so long it's like it's now a part of me. Who am I if I'm not flaring? I want the flare to stop because it sucks, but am afraid I'll feel lost if it does. 

I know how wonderful remission is, had 7 years of it until this flare, but it's almost like my brain doesn't really remember and is okay living like this even if I don't want to. I'm doing everything my GI tells me, so I'm not missing doses or eating things I shouldn't trying to make myself sicker or anything. The flare just seems like a part of me now and I don't know what to do if it goes away.

Does this make sense? Am I completely losing my mind? What's wrong with me? 

I do have a therapist, but we've been more focused on working through past trauma than what's going on in my head in regards to this flare and now she's on maternity leave until September.

329,Stelara,Switching to Stelara after almost a decade on Infliximab,"Posting to hear if anyone has had similar stories with these drugs and their disease. I’m trying to decide if I should stick it out, switch, or do something else completely. I have Crohn’s, 27F diagnosed at 18. 

I’ve been on Infliximab since being diagnosed almost 9 years ago. I was initially on Remicade and eventually switched to other similar biologics like inflectra because of insurance - not because of any issues. They all worked great for me, except I did get pushed to a 6 week dose after the first year because it was too long of a time period for me to wait 8 weeks. 

Anyways, I’ve been in full remission until a few months ago. I had shingles in January and ended up having to delay an infusion and from there things kind of spiraled. My antibody levels are good - no antibodies and the drug level is solid. I also had a colonoscopy last week and it did confirm I have inflammation in my colon where I did when originally diagnosed. No Cdiff, and also did poop samples etc. and everything is coming back pretty normal but shows inflammation. 

My doctor called today and said he suggests I switch to Stelara or Skyrizi because the infliximab is no longer working for my body since drug levels/antibodies are ok. He talked through and I’m pretty sure I’m going to go forward with Stelara. 

My question - has anyone had a similar experience where they were on infliximab for a long time and then had to switch to a different drug? I’m wondering your experience. 

My main concern right now is if I stop the infliximab infusions, I won’t be able to go back to them. Limiting my options is a bit scary since I’m so young. Stelara may work for me, but if it doesn’t, I feel like I may spiral down a deep wormhole until I end up on an operating table as the only solution. I’m considering staying on Infliximab for another few months just to see if things improve, although I have low hopes. Advice?

330,Stelara,First Stelara infusion,"I found out I had Crohn’s disease in December 2023. It was and still is hard for me to believe or accept I have Crohn’s. My GI doctor put me in skyrizi first. I did 3 infusions of Skyrizi and stopped before we reached the at home injection because the third infusion did not work at all for me. It sucked because the first two infusions felt like they cured me of all my symptoms. 

Moving into my first and only Stelara infusion, I felt okay for majority of the day after my infusion. I got home and took a nap, woke up and later went to play pickleball at the park. I got home around 8 and ate some dinner. I was sitting at my dinner table for about an hour and noticed I was having trouble breathing. And it would not go away. After almost an hour I told my mom and she checked my oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood pressure. My oxygen was good majority of the time, my heart rate was 120s while I was sitting for 2+ hours and my blood pressure was high as well. 

We contacted the on call providers and my sister messaged my GI dr (we work with him). They told me to take some medicine that’s over the counter and see if it helped after an hour, if not go to the ER. 
It didn’t get better, went to ER, they did no airway check, barely did any tests- only a chest xray and blood work. Refused to give me a CT of my abdomen after I expressed stomach pains. And yes I told them I was just treated for Crohn’s with a new medication that day. They sent me home with “anxiety” from my treatment. I still could not breathe well. I was breathing like I just ran a mile whether I had been sitting for a while or walking. My GI Dr was furious and sent me to do a stat CT to check for a PE and a stat CT of my abdomen. I even went to my primary care and they did an EKG and a lung test.

All of my scans and test came back normal. No PE or anything else of the sorts. Just showed some constipation but nothing major. My heavy breathing/shortness of breath was still persistent. Eventually after days of bed rest and taking steroids my breathing got better. It’s not fully better to this day (this happened in march) I get shortness of breath more often than I used to before my Stelara infusion. 

We believe I had some sort of allergic reaction to the infusion. GI Dr plans for me to still try my injection of Stelara and see how I react before we switch meds again. 

I wanted to come on here and see if anyone else has had similar reaction to Stelara infusion or the at home injection?

331,Stelara,Skyrizi vs remicade?,"So I just starred skyrizi 2 weeks ago, ended up in the hospital because of a flare that started before my infusion, and now my gastro wants to break out the big guns and switch to remicade.

Few things are stopping me from switching:

1. Took gastro 3 months to file the paperwork for the skyrizi, while I was un-medicated, so what's to stop him from taking forever to file for remicade?

2. Even though I was in a massive flare up (didn't know cause internally I was feeling great, thought I pulled an abdominal muscle from gerd coughing) the skyrizi helped and it was my first infusion.

2. I was on stelara and even though it wasn't kicking the crohns into remission it still helped considerably. With skyrizi it targets both interlukin 10 and 12, where as the stelara only targets one of them. 

So I'm thinking with the fact that the stelara helped, and after my first infusion of skyrizi helping me so much even though I was in a full blown flare, that the skyrizi would be the one to work.

3. If I switch to remicade and it doesn't work due to it targetting something else, I might be back at square one again.

4. Skyrizi has a lot less side effects than any other drug, I know it's new but still. Plus the on body injectors is basically a mini infusion every time.

Idk. My gut is telling me skyrizi but my doc is telling me to switch to the big guns. 

Just want to know how you fine folk decide to switch, and if I should switch, because skyrizi helped a ton even though I was in a full blown flare. 

I know med switching is a normal thing till you find the right one, but with how things went down the last 4 months and my gastro is an idiot in the first place, I don't known what to do...

333,Stelara,Remicade causing psoriasis,"Hey everyone. I learned recently that I've developed psoriasis, likely as a result from Remicade. My GI said this is really too bad, as I have a history of severe CD (fistula, strictures) that was put in remission from a combination of Remicade and azathioprine. However, we must stop the Remicade now that I have psoriasis. He said he has used Stelara and Entyvio for patients who don't respond to or can't take Remicade, but in his experience, they haven't worked as well. He also said he's willing to look into Rinvoq, but he's never used it before. 

Has anyone else been in this situation before? How did you decide on next steps, and what are questions I should be asking my doctor? I'm pretty unnerved by all this, and I'm really worried about what my future will look like.

334,Stelara,Scared &amp; unsure about current symptoms ,"Hi everyone, I’m a 24 yr. old woman &amp; I was diagnosed with CD in 2021. I initially was treated with Budesonide &amp; Mesalamine &amp; switched to Stelara in 2022. 
Last April in 2023 I was told I was in remission. I also have IBS so have never stopped having digestive symptoms; they’ve just changed.

I’ve been having lots of constipation for awhile now &amp; in March started having blood in stool &amp; on tp (the tp when wiping I know is from hemorrhoids). Took my latest injection on 4/14, had more abdominal pain than usual before this one. Also had pretty bad pain on 4/12 &amp; 4/17. Saw my Dr. yesterday &amp; told her about the blood, she suggested maybe doing another colonoscopy soon, but I don’t want to unless I need to. 

Currently, needing to address my constipation &amp; she gave me some Lynzess to try, I’m also going to slowly increase dietary fiber. She’s also changing my injections to every 7 weeks instead of 8. Symptoms are blood in toilet with stool (bright red), lower back pain, soft stool when going but never feeling able to completely empty, and occasionally that squeezy, crampy, abdominal pain. Basically I’m wondering if some you have this issues as well, what you do for relief &amp; if I should be concerned about some complication.

335,Stelara,Live Vaccines - Breastfeeding,"I know this question has been asked in one form or another in the past, but looking for some more real life guidance while I wait to hear back from a pediatrician/ gastroenterologist.

I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant, and months ago, my Gastroenterologist gave me the go ahead to be able to breastfeed while on Stelara. However, they just clarified yesterday that baby would not be able to receive live vaccines while breastfeeding. I’m not sure why this took me by surprise, but I’m a little disappointed. At the end of the day, I can’t change my diagnosis, and these are the cards I’ve been dealt, and I’ll do whatever is best for the baby’s health and well being.

That being said, wondering if anyone here has had to deal with this as well. Specifically: How long does breastfeeding have to be stopped before a baby can have certain live vaccines?

In general, could anyone share their experience with breastfeeding on a biologic, how that process went, how baby is doing? Anyone decide against breastfeeding in favor of formula due to this issue specifically? I’d love to hear it all, just be gentle with me. LOL

336,Stelara,I hate depending on the government (venting),"It has been a month with no news of Stelara arrival. This week I am already 1 week late. Long periods of lateness are rare, last time was 2 years ago. But that time it took 3 months to arrive which was almost 2 months late for me but at least I was on Azathioprine then.

  
I stopped Azathioprine because my doctor insisted due to the potential negatives Aza can have, and besides it was already generating more moles than usual on my skin, which is not inherently bad but quick apparition of moles in short periods is a risk factor. I hope next week Stelara arrive. I don't want to be every week with an anxious ""are we there yet"" running on my mind. My anxious possibly Adhd ass does not need another tab open on my brain.

337,Stelara,I just want to thank you all!,"I’m recently diagnosed after years of “mystery illness hypochondria” and I have some serious issues with my liver being congested that are still a mystery I’m getting worked up for. 

So. It’s just such a relief to have a diagnosis, a treatment plan, something that I can actually identify as the cause for all my ailments. 

A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with small bowel Crohn’s by pill cam after relatively clean endoscopy and colonoscopy (only 2 erosions in the ileum)… but the pill cam showed that the bottom 2nd and 3rd sections were full of erosions. They started me on budesonide and my poops are somewhat solid again! Waiting on insurance authorizations for Stelara! I feel so much better already and I only just started treatment!

But back to You All, Y’all, this Sub!!!

I want to thank you for your posts, your insights, your advice, just being here for me. I never had a place before and now I really feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me. I have a place to vent, I have a place to learn what’s going on with me, what to expect, just a way that I can stop crying and trauma dumping on my friends and family making the BBQ awkward. 

I don’t know what else is going on with me, I have a big appointment this Friday at the hospital for an MRI and possible same day consult, I’m freaking out a little. Liver issues are not Crohn’s related though so once I figure that out I will find that sub. 

But I feel terrible, my belly is a mess, people keep congratulating me on my “pregnancy” (not preggo) and I’m juggling a half dozen specialist appointments and all sorts of crap.

It’s nice to have a place where I can celebrate the massive relief budesonide has given me in a few weeks. Guys. My pooping isn’t hurting! I’ve lost 10 lbs! I’m eating so much better already. 

The pill cam also showed that I have a severe case of early dumping syndrome, 8 min stomach time, 4 hour total transit time….

I’ve been telling my doctors for years that I felt awful, horrible, but my bloodwork was good except for chronic leukocytosis (high WBC). My only real GI symptom started in June of 2022 with intractable vomiting that was slowing my heart dangerously. 

But it ends up Crohns can manifest as everything I have been complaining about. They said I had inflammation. But it took years to figure out where. Ends up it was in a few feet length of my small intestine. 

This journey has sucked. But I’m hoping it gets better. Thank you all for understanding me, I feel like no one else does.

341,Stelara,Crohn's for over 45 years,"I was diagnosed when I was 12.  The only option at that time , for a flair, was surgery or Prednisone.  My doctor's were very conservative and did not want to cut since there was a good chance of it coming back.  I finally had 6 inches of small intestine removed when the pred stopped working for me at 20yo.  I have been very fortunate to only have a few flairs and issues since my surgery.  But Crohn's is still always with me.
I am curious to know if any other ""long-term"" Crohn's folks have other conditions that are ""blamed"" on Crohn's or steroid use.  For example I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia after the birth of my child.  I had to have cataract surgery for both eyes in my 40's.  Had both hips replaced in my 50's and still have a great deal of chronic pain due to oestioarthritis.i am frequently told I am too young for all these things.
I try really hard to be positive and roll with the punches.  I feel 20 years older physically than my age.  Just recently I've allowed myself the grace to not feel like if I pushed harder I could do more physically.  I do what I can, when I can.  Just looking for others who are in similar situations and what has helped.
I just started Stelara last week and hoping it keeps my Crohn's at bay and also helps with general inflammation.  My first biologic.  Treatment has come so far in my lifetime.

343,Stelara,Omvoh (mirikizumab) (similar to Stelara) approved for UC but not for Crohns??," Well I just found out that Omvoh (mirikizumab) was approved for UC but not for Crohns.  
 

It seems that every other biologic that works for UC also works for  Crohns, so I am wondering why they did not approved for Crohns.... the  more options the better (well at least for the patients) since the  biologics costs are supposed to come down.  
 

I am now on Stelera, and it did nothing for me until they upped up the dose to 1 shot every 4 weeks.  
 

I just had my Calprotectin test done and its around 200 so that is good  news. Every 4 weeks did the trick for me. It still is not as good as  Remicade (Calc around 50 on a high dose) but I feel much better since I  am fine and I am not catching colds all the time.  
 With Remicade I was all the time with a cold and I had to take a lot of  antibiotics, 2 or 3 weeks after I stopped them the infections got back.  
 

But the problem is that it was a battle to get Stelara approved to every  4 weeks by the insurance company. This year probably it will be the  same. Considering that its around 25k every month I don't blame them.

344,Stelara,What a headache!,"I’m the most recent victim of the machinations of SaveOnSP. My company switched insurance carriers to Highmark BCBS, and they offer SaveOnSP, which is apparently a scam sort of company. They are being sued by Johnson &amp; Johnson because they are a copay maximizer company. Basically, they try to squeeze the pharmaceutical company’s patient financial assistance program for all they can and STILL want you to pay fully too! 

So they put in a stop order for my Stelara and tried to force me to join their optional program. After several calls (and a lot of misdirection on their part*), I realized there was literally no benefit to me on my high deductible plan. So I unenrolled, and they spent days still trying to stop my Stelara order. 

Finally, I was able to get SaveOnSP and the pharmacy on the phone together and get this resolved. I’m going to pay out of pocket and get the reimbursement just so no colluding interests try to go after my financial assistance again. 

Hopefully it all goes through just fine. 😭
As one last push, the pharmacy told me I’d be responsible for 30% coinsurance still because it’s a specialty medication. (They’re in cahoots if I didn’t make that clear earlier.) But I know it can’t be true because my deductible is my out of pocket max. But it still got under my skin, so I’m worried. 

*they said IRS has ruled I have to pay my own deductible. They said at the end of the year (after I met my max out of pocket??), they would pick up all extra costs. They said after I met my deductible (which is all I pay), they would pick up the 30% co-insurance.

345,Stelara,I need help/feeling desperate,"I am currently in hospital after 6 months of horrific symptoms.  up to 40 bm's a day, nausea vomiting.  I've been on a liquid diet since August.  CT exams showed bowel wall thickening up to 7 mm of my ascending colon (never had Crohn's visible there before), skip lesions, and free fluid in my peritoneal cavity.  I have low iron, low red blood cells, low hemoglobin, low ALT.  I can only stop vomiting by injecting myself with an IM Gravol.  My GI has been ignoring my pleas for help.  Insisted I get an MRI.  I've been waiting for 6 months.  Things took a turn when I suddenly began to have bloody diarrhea (I've been diagnosed with Crohn's for 20 years, had two resections in the past 6 of the terminal ileum and have plenty of mucous but never blood) I am on Stelara.  I never leave the house.  I am often incontinent.  Severely fatigued.  I have been to the hospital 3 times in the past 6 months for rehydration.  Each time they did imaging and wanted to admit me, but I refused because of lack of beds (did not want to sleep in a chair in the ER) But this time, with the bloody diarrhea and the CT showing inflammation in terminal ileum as well as ascending colon and being unable to keep even fluid down, I relented.  They've been treating me with IV meds, vitamins, fluids, and steroids.I finally had a MRI two days ago.  I was just told my MRI was clean and this is not Crohn's.

I feel insane.  How can this be?  I've had two CT's (One of them 3 D) that showed extensive disease activity but the MRI is clean?  My GI has written me off.  The doctor on call had the nerve to ask me if there was something else going on in my life.  Yeah, I'm freaking sick, haven't been able to leave the bed or bathroom for 6 months and can't eat anything but broth.  That is what is wrong.  My abdominal pain is 8/10.  Aside from this my life is stable.  I have an amazing marriage, a career I love, and a wonderful family.  They just cleared me for CDiff so it isn't that either.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are still reading has anyone had this happen?  I feel like I am going crazy.  I have lost 15 lbs.  I feel like I want to die I am so nauseous all the time.  I was CERTAIN given my CT results and blood work that it was my Crohn's.  But they say it's not.  What am I supposed to do?  They won't give me any steroids, it's a long weekend and I'm stuck here until they do an endoscopy on Tuesday which I doubt will show anything.  I honestly feel like giving up.  I have ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis as well, I can manage that pain.  But I cannot manage feeling like this anymore.

Thanks for listening.  I feel so hopeless and alone.

UPDATE \*\*\*

So just an update.  It turns out I am in adrenal failure (even though I've not been on steroids in over 2 years). If I hadn't come to hospital I would be dead now.  They have me on 150 mg IV pred a day for 3 days and then the endocrinologist is going to try different hormones/steroids to figure out if I've developed Addison's disease (bringing me to autoimmune disease number 5)

I was last hospitalized with adrenal failure after tapering off prednisone in 2020.  They haven't checked my levels ONCE since then.  But a very smart doc who just happened to be in charge of my case today read my entire medical file (we joked it is like War and Peace) and put two and two together.  Normal cortisol levels are 111-444 and mine are 11.  No wonder I felt like I was dying, and the only time I've felt remotely better is when I am on steroids.  Such a scary day.

I officially stopped Prednisolone since April 2023. 9 months off this stupid drug and I finally got my face back!!! I can’t believe this was how I looked. Gives me so much trauma and bad memories on how I hated the way I looked and also felt terrible on it, but I’m glad my Stelara is working and managed to keep me away from steroids. I pray I won’t need it again anytime soon. I just want my normal face and clear skin to last with me. I was 19 yrs old at that time so you can imagine how I struggled in college with low self-esteem. If anyone here is struggling with moon face, just to let you know it goes away and you’ll feel yourself again! 💜",2024-01-28 13:29:43,CrohnsDisease,280,1ad2ops,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ad2ops/transition_2022_2024/,2024-01-28
349,Stelara,Back at square one and looking to vent a little.,"Yesterday I had my first follow-up appointment with my GI after starting on Inflectra (Remicade) in September. I've been feeling great in terms of my gastrointestinal health, but about a month ago I developed what I thought was eczema all over my body, starting on my arms, which I offhandedly mentioned to my doctor. She looked at it and immediately recognized it as a bad psoriasis ""explosion"" caused by the Remicade, and she advised to stop the infusions. Apparently about 3% of Remicade users develop this, and I'm in the lucky 3%. So, now I have to get my prescription for a cream to fix that, go to a dermatologist for the psoriasis on my scalp (which I thought was just unrelated dandruff caused by the dry winter air), and then start over on a new biologic. My doctor recommended either Stelara or Skyrizi.

I'm glad this skin issue is getting solved, because it's been making me feeling HORRIBLE about myself sometimes, but I really thought that Remicade was working out for me. 

Feeling a little discouraged and overwhelmed, but it'll be okay. I keep reminding myself of all the other ways my body is still functioning well for me. It's not all crashing and burning. And I have a wonderful team of medical professionals and friends and family supporting me.

How's your experience been with Stelara or Skyrizi? My doctor is leaning toward Skyrizi for me, but gave me the final choice. 

Has anyone else experienced psoriasis as a side effect?",2024-01-24 12:38:58,CrohnsDisease,15,19eg5lp,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/19eg5lp/back_at_square_one_and_looking_to_vent_a_little/,2024-01-24

360,Stelara,Crohn’s and IBS?,"I have mild to moderate Crohn’s in my ilium and  was officially diagnosed earlier this year after a colonoscopy a year earlier in early 2022 (unrelated to Crohn’s) caught some inflammation. At first I had no symptoms but I started getting them (bloating, pain, nausea, weight loss) about 4-5 months ago and have been on Stelara for four months.

Recently I had some good news that my cal pro test showed my inflammation was at normal levels after it was raised when I first started Stelara. However, I haven’t stopped having symptoms and if anything they seem to be getting more constant. Since the doctor was happy with my stool test but concerned about weight loss and my stomach discomfort, he’s had me to tests for other issues like SIBO but everything came out fine. I should mention I follow a modified version of the IBD aid diet and eat very clean, I’ll be starting up with another dietitian soon. 

Ive read folks with IBD can also have IBS. However, when that’s the case, how is it diagnosed if someone doesn’t have IBS first, and starts with IBD? And is that common for IBS to come after IBD? There’s a chance we will do other tests like an endoscopy to see if we’re missing any other inflammation issues and I’ll get another colonoscopy sometime in 2024, but I’m just trying to get to the bottom of this. My GI and I are chatting more at the end of next week as well since my recent tests like SIBO didn’t show anything.

363,Stelara,Inflammatory arthritis,"I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 14 years ago. I’ve had episodes of inflammatory arthritis on and off during this time, generally affecting either my big toes or my ankles. My doctor investigated it years ago and put it down to inflammatory arthritis from my Crohn’s disease.

I had a bowel resection for severe Crohn’s 9 years ago, but since then I’ve been pretty stable on Mercaptopurine. At the time I had very minimal typical Crohn’s symptoms; no abdo pain, no significant changes to my bowels. My biggest symptom was lethargy.

Recently my Gastroenterologist wanted me to stop Mercaptopurine because of LFT derangement, and that he didn’t want me on it for more than 10 years due to long term risks (e.g. increased risk of skin cancer etc).

I’ve been off all Crohn’s meds for 5 months now, which is longer than planned because I became sick with other health issues, and currently awaiting brain surgery (long story). My Gastroenterologist wants to start me on Stelara, and thinks it will be safe to start prior to my brain surgery. I’m awaiting to get approval to start Stelara, and I contacted my Gastroenterologist the other day because I still haven’t heard anything about starting it (it’s been about 3 weeks since he decided I should be starting it), and so I’m waiting to hear back from him.

Over the past 4 weeks or so I’ve had a sore ankle on and off, which I had been doing a bit hiking and so put it down to that. But in the past week my ankle is now intermittently swollen, and sometimes feels hot to touch. The swelling goes down over night, but if I’ve been standing or walking on it a lot, it swells back up. It’s very typical of my previous inflammatory arthritis symptoms. Should I be concerned that this might mean my Crohn’s is also active? Is it possible to get a flare of inflammatory arthritis while having minimal intestinal Crohn’s flare?",2023-11-12 00:34:17,CrohnsDisease,2,17t8ctf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17t8ctf/inflammatory_arthritis/,2023-11-12

I recently switched from entivyo (it stopped working) to Stelara. 
I’ve only have the initial infusion dose and 1 maintenance dose. After my infusion I got a cold and then a bad sinus infection. Took me out for like a week+. And lasting effects after. I recovered. 
Did my self injection 3.5 weeks ago and didn’t feel any bad effects shortly after. 
Cut to last week I got a cold and a very bad sinus infection, even worse than last time. Like so intense, I felt like I was hit by a bus. 

Now the antibiotics treating the sinusitis got me running to the toilet with bloody mucus dia and laying down with cramps so bad, they remind me of the pain I had when I got diagnosed about 19 years ago. 

I guess my question is, anyone else on Stelara get these intense painful sinus infections after a cold?

372,Skyrizi,Nervous about surgery,"I’m 20, and have had Crohn’s for the last 10 years and it’s been an absolute mess. I got diagnosed, started taking a medication for a year or two. Never reached remission, got super close but was 12/13 and got super spotty with taking my medications. In my defense, It was a horse pill and I had to take like 9 of them a day. So I stopped taking them, my parents straight up didn’t notice and never cared too much because they’ve always downplayed Crohn’s. 

Fast forward to when I was 16 and I was super skinny, my hair was falling out, I had a 4% attendance record for school. I told my parents I needed to go to the doctor and start medications again and after a few months I eventually went. My doctors threw around the word “strictures” and I never knew what they meant other than my intestines were messed up. And honestly, I didn’t know much about my own disease for the majority of having it because I never felt like it was a big deal. I learned to get used to feeling bloated and having stomach pains 24/7 and always feeling like I’m gonna shit for just being excited/anxious. Anyways, my doctors put me on Remicade and I did in-hospital infusions for about 1-2 years. I gained like 45 pounds in that year and a half, was depressed, had all sorts of side effects and was still having flares. So I went off of it and started Skyrizi (which I’m currently still on). Skyrizi hasn’t necessarily changed anything for me, I still flare. I honestly can’t imagine my life not in pain or not bloated. I can still function because that’s what I know how to do but I’ve talked to my doctor about medication and she said she wanted me to get a surgeon’s approval. 

So, now I’m in college and I met with a surgeon and they looked at my scans and want to take 10in of my small intestine (the ileum), part of my colon, and my appendix out in 2-3 weeks. I’m so scared. I’ve never had surgery, I’ve heard the after is super painful. I don’t wanna restart with crohns. I can’t even imagine feeling better and I just am terrified to go under anesthesia and have scars on my stomach and I just was posting here for the chance that maybe someone has had surgery and could tell me what it’s like? Will I be in a bunch of pain? Will I be limited afterwards? I just have never felt like Crohn’s was real and everyone kind of pretends it doesn’t exist so the surgery just makes it real and I’m nervous.

375,Skyrizi,Did anyone delay taking biologics? Stricture advice?,"I am not sure what I am looking for here exactly, but has anyone delayed taking biologics? Has anyone dealt with a stricture? 

I was diagnosed in 2019, severe Crohn’s, have always used the smaller meds like mesalamine, LDN, steroids. Have had pretty poor quality of life and just dealt with it because biologics seemed scary, and thinking I could “naturally” heal my gut. There have been times where I felt “better” but it was just normal for me. It finally got to a point where I felt it was time so I’ve been on Skyrizi since July 2025 this year - and this has been the most relief I have had since my diagnosis. You truly don’t realize how bad you are until you start improving. 

Just had a colonoscopy last week where they had to stop as they couldn’t fit the scope through, due to a stricture in my sigmoid colon about 30cm in. Have to get a CT now to get that checked out and really freaking out about the possibility of surgery. 

I am just feeling extremely regretful that I did not go on biologics sooner. Because of my neglect of my disease, I now have scar tissue. I was told when I was diagnosed, that the damage Crohn’s can cause is way worse than what biologics can do. And I still didn’t listen. :(

From what I understand our medicines make us moderately compromised. Do I need to make sure I’m wearing gloves while I work in the garden now - to avoid rarer fungal and other things in the soil?

I gave it a while but when it came time to pay up again recently ($750 every quarter for me) I decided not too because why pay so much money for a medication that isn't working and hasn't for a while?

I had a colonoscopy yesterday and I have inflammation in my colon (obviously already knew this from all the pain and blood in the toilet). My GI was upset that I discontinued the Skyrizi and said ""Some people just need to increase the frequency and take it once a month instead of every two"".

Does this sound right? He didn't even bring up the possibility of me developing antibodies. I'm not really sure I trust that, I know he has some kind of sweetheart deal going on with Abbvie because last time I had an appointment an Abbvie rep was there in the room with us (Very weird, they couldn't even answer any of the questions I asked either).

380,Skyrizi,How to live life again and do sports?,"There’s a good 50% chance I used the wrong live/life word here.. 

ANYWAYS I am about to turn 19 and am currently on Skyrizi, which I think we‘re about to continue for a while. I am not noticing many changes tho and prednisolone is slowly being tapered off.
The issue at hand is, that I am still in pain of Crohn’s disease a lot and I wake up multiple times at night and can barely ever get enough sleep. I also feel weak and like my body doesn’t get as much energy as I would like for it to have, so often I will go to a store and grip to the cart like a lifeline. If I’m on higher doses of prednisolone the crohns symptoms get lowered, but I get the weak immune system and energy from prednisolone. Overall either options mess with my body and make it weaker, which has basically stopped me from working out at the gym or going to football practise. 

I have heard success stories of Skyrizi, which I am hoping will be my story too, but those often took months to get into remission. I don’t think I can live like this for another couple of months tho, I am not willing to give up sports for that long. My lifestyle is always active and I still go on walks a lot, but even when walking the neighbours dog, I can barely put in 30 seconds of running so that the dog actually gets to go at a different speed for once. 
I just want to ask, if anyone has found ways to make the body able to do sports again. I am totally fine with doing a 1-2 hour „workout“ and then resting the rest of the day, if it means I get to enjoy the sports period. [home workouts are not off the table but I gotta say, I have never really enjoyed them much..] Now mind you, rhere are better moments than others, so sometimes I am feeling pretty fine, but still not well enough to go to football practise, because it’s competitive and I’m not sure I’d pace myself in this area. So I’d want to start of wirh easy stuff like going on a (slow) run or biking. Can someone please help me figure out a way to give my body the energy to do this at least twice a week or sth?

385,Skyrizi,BF New to Crohns,"My bf (24) was officially diagnosed in June/July. He has had bloody stool and pain since at least 2023 but it took us forever to get him into a GI. He'd been on mesalamine and budesonide for at least a year, but shortly after he was diagnosed his insurance stopped covering the budesonide. He immediately started declining and the GI said they'd put him on Skyrizi. Well, weeks go by and they never get back to us while he's still getting worse. A couple weeks ago he got a call from AbbVie and had to confirm information before they talked to Optimum (I was not here for this part so I'm not really sure what all that was about). We did not hear back, so on Thursday he called his GI to see what the holdup is, and they said they would reach out to AbbVie on Monday if we hadn't heard back by then. Friday, he called out of work because he was very lethargic, nauseous, lightheaded, no appetite, and cramping really bad. Saturday we went to the ER because we decided that he can't wait until Monday. His hemoglobin was 8, and they decided not to give him a blood transfusion but gave him IV fluids and steroids. We left with his first ever prescription of prednisone and levsin for the cramps. Sunday he felt weak but better, and Monday there was still pain and blood but I still think he felt better than he had for a long time. He called the GI and they said they'd call AbbVie and get back to him (they didn't call back). This morning there's been more blood and he was so lightheaded that I insisted I drive him to work. His mom is a nurse and says we need to take him to the ER again, but he only has one day of PTO left so we'd prefer not to use that if we can help it. We also want to avoid a second ER bill (American healthcare 😐). He only got 5 days of pred and it's looking like he'll run out before they get him on Skyrizi, but I'm not sure what else the ER could do.

His GI only does appointments on Wednesdays and is backed up for months so he can't get in to see him. We've had some problems with this GI though because he hasn't given us any education about Crohn's, lifestyle changes, or anything else helpful.

What I have noticed personally

Stopped Skyrizi and was on pantoprazole. Was experiencing the Crohn’s coming back (skyrizi got delayed by 3 weeks and it was causing severe fatigue) Switched to famotidine. As long as I get my morning dose I seem to stay pretty good as long as I stay away from dairy (I’m lactose intolerant but was tolerant on skyrizi). 

Anecdotal but wanted to share my story. My diet typically consists of high protein. Candy and sweet seems to make me worse. Even fairlife milk doesn’t quite work for me.

395,Skyrizi,Crohn’s Disease Pain Management?,"Hi everyone! I had a question and I’m looking for everyone’s remedies when it comes to managing the pain. I’ve been diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease since February of 2018, and I went through a small flare-up, lost weight, my doctor was able to start me on Remicade and that put me in remission! Woot!…. Until 2020 after my daughter was born. I have been in a major flare up since then, and I am finally fighting with insurance on beginning a new biologic because I became allergic to Remicade, I had an anaphylactic episode during an infusion appointment. Not fun. 

What do you do for pain? My doctor prescribed me an opioid for a short amount of time, and it was helpful, but now I’m no longer on it. I’m really just taking my Prednisone (which I’ve been on for far too long but everyone is worried to stop it because I’ve been taking it so long) and Tylenol. I use my heating pad when the cramps get bad. And now I’ve started throwing up after every meal. 

Please help with tips and tricks until I can start my Skyrizi, it’s really affecting my quality of life and job at this point…",2025-08-01 15:21:56,CrohnsDisease,1,1mezch9,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mezch9/crohns_disease_pain_management/,2025-08-01

I went through their gut health assessment and gave them my calprotectin level of 4560 and they suggested I start on the green protocol of CurQD. Anyone tried this and can tell me how well it worked for them? So far, I’ve tried Prednisone, Rinvoq and Skyrizi for medications. I was on Prednisone for less than a week and had to stop due to high blood sugars, Rinvoq gave me bad side effects and my CRP levels went up while on it, and Skyrizi seems to at least be getting my CRP level down again but my colonoscopy still shows severe inflammation and my calprotectin is still high. I’ve also changed my diet but that still hasn’t worked great, so I’m not trying any more diet changes. So I’m considering adding Evinature to my supplement regime to see how it works but don’t want to waste money on it if it doesn’t work well. I also looked at local supplement stores for alternatives for CurQD, and I can find Curcumin supplements but nowhere has Qing Dai, not even my local health supplements store and Amazon Canada doesn’t either.",2025-07-21 23:17:37,CrohnsDisease,0,1m5y9e0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m5y9e0/evinature_curqd_effective_or_snake_oil/,2025-07-21
400,Skyrizi,What happens at the end of all treatments when there are no more options?,"My sister has severe medicine-resistant stricture based Crohns Disease, and she has tried about everything - Skyrizi just was the recent failure, but everything from Remicade to you-name-it, it doesnt work. She has colitis on top of it, but it is the crohns repeatedly throwing her to hospital.

Im starting to get very scared for her. She is weeks away from her fourth major surgery to fix yet another area causing blockages due to extreme scarring and inflammation. She is only 36. They say they believe she still has enough intestine to avoid short bowel syndrome, but he seemes very uncertain.

Her next surgery is on the 8th, but she just had to be rushed to the hospital for the 4th time in two months. They give her prednisone and send her home, often without even the pleaaure of the most basic opiod prescription because they say they basically only prescribe pain pills for cancer patients and they worry about constipation, despite the fact she took morphine for her crohns for almost a decade with no such issue. 

Im genuinely not sure what to do anymore. The life she is living is insanity, 24/7 bedridden agony.  What is life going to be like when she is 40? Or 50? With nothing to dull the pain and no crohns medicine that helps?

I have severe anxiety disorder and i took care of my mom until the day she died of pancreatic cancer held her hand as she went. I take care of all my sisters needs currently and will do so until im dead, but i am getting increasing terrified that i will not be capable of caring for the needs of someone whom the doctors refuse to treat with real relief for her pain, and whose life currently consists of lying on the floor screaming at the top of her lungs in pain. I have sought every legal remedy imaginable to try to lessen the pain - genuinely every single one - and the only things that do touch the pain is fraught with its own risks. But i do know she is not currently living any kind of life while waiting for this surgery. Her floor is lvl 6 pain even when she dont need surgery but this... this is too much.

So..

1. If we can find no medicine that helps, what does the progression typically look like from here if she is already at 4th surgery?

2. I know life expectacy will shorten, but can she do any normal activities if she gets short bowel syndrome?

3. We have money and means. Is there any doctor or hospital highly recommended by the crohns community that has proven effective at treating crohns disease in patients for whom nothing has worked?

4. Any other advice for me as her caretaker? I feel like my anxiety spills over into her headspace when she is screaming in agony and i make it worse for her because she can see me having a panic attack and i cant stop it. 

Thank you for any advice you all can share. This morning i thought she was ok, she got up and baked banana pancakes which she only ever does if she is feeling ok,  but an hour after eating she was like ""i need to take a bath for the pain"", and then by the end of the bath telling me she is literally in so much pain she cant even move anymore. What changed i dont know  usually the pain builds gradually to go from 6 to 11 but here she went from 4 (because she was cooking the pancakes a good indicator of a ""good day"") to a lvl 12 (ive only seen her this bad once before) in the space of an hour. But i am panicking about how bad things have been for her...

It started with recurrent abscesses in my rectum, setons, etc. I have had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, pill capsule study - none showed any signs of Crohn’s disease. However, the aggression of my abscesses and two fistulas have lead my team to believe I have Crohn’s in spite of no further evidence. I also did not have any major symptoms before the fistulas/abscesses. Other than urgency and loose stools. First, we tried remicade. After my third infusion I had three separate intense “attacks” where the cramping was so intense that I think something is seriously wrong, nausea, etc. lasts anywhere from 3-12 hours. Excruciating. I stopped remicade after that at my doctors instruction. I have a loop illeostomy currently and I started skyrizi a couple months back. I had my second infusion on 7/7. Last night I had an intense “attack” from 9pm-1:30am. It was so bad I thought I had a blockage and worried about my intestines rupturing. During the attack I went to the ER and they did a cat scan. No blockage but colitis seen in both large and small intestine. I don’t know what this is doctors don’t know I’m so desperate for some answers. I doubt anyone can provide insight but I had to try.

404,Skyrizi,"Nurse stuck me ten times, couldn't hit a vein, and now I have a weird nerve thing happening??","I was due for a skyrizi infusion this past week. currently in the process of redoing my loading doses, so it was the last of 3 infusions before returning to the autoinjector.

as many of you probably understand, my veins are totally shot from 15+ years of infusions and blood draws and millions of IVs. one vein has scar tissue built up so much you can see it under my skin. 

I warn every nurse/phlebotomist about this. It's a normal occurrence for me to be stuck a couple times unsuccessfully. many, many times I've had nurses/phlebotomists have a pediatric nurse or someone else come stick me after being unsuccessful. I often recommend that we use a warm compress because i know it'll be rough. I don't have a problem with being stuck over and over - usually they apologize a bunch and I'm like it's totally fine, just do what you can. the only time I ask someone to stop is when they're wiggling around in my arm forever and it starts to hurt.

so before this infusion, I made sure to drink a ton of water and try to eat well, etc. Nurse stuck me like 10 times. she ran out of needles (since we were at my house) and actually reused the same needle for multiple sticks - i should've said something but i was desperate to get my meds (been having more symptoms). you guys know how this goes - they stick you and wiggle around trying to get the vein. i pointed out all my ""best"" veins and pulled out my heating pad and kept sucking down water.

at one point she hit a nerve. this has never happened to me before. it was a sudden weird shock feeling down in my wrist while she was moving the needle in the inside of my elbow.

this was Wednesday, and now every time I move my wrist/arm a certain way, i get a weird twinge in my nerve. its not exactly painful, just weird and uncomfortable. today it has been happening more often and its weirding me out. it has me a bit scared. 

do i need to be concerned? is this something i should see a doctor for? or will it just take some time to heal?

I'm used to blown veins and being bruised as hell, but this is new.

(as an aside, I've already decided to call the homecare company and request a new nurse. my mom works closely with a different homecare company and she was SHOCKED about how this nurse handled things and told me to definitely call and complain. i wasnt so concerned initially because i know my veins are the problem, but the nerve thing and seeing her reuse the needle definitely have me concerned.)

I have seen a neurologist. I passed the physical exam and they didn’t think I had MS. They said there was a small T2 spot in an MRI I had a month ago, but thought the T2 spot because it was so small was one that comes with age vs MS. I’m having another MRI this upcoming week to rule MS in or out.

That being said, I read on one of the crohns and colitis sites that having crohn’s can increase the chance of peripheral neuropathy or CIDP.

Did anyone else have something like this, and once they went on a biologic, it improved because it was due to the inflammation in the rest of the body?

410,Skyrizi,Coping with being on prednisone long-term (multiple years),"Edit: guys. I'm so insanely aware of how bad being on prednisone long term is. This is NOT my choice. Yes I'm taking precautions for bone health.

29 year old with a 22 year history of Crohn's here, so not new to this just frustrated 🙃

I've been on prednisone for a YEAR. Was previously well controlled on 6MP -- a very low dose too, with no side effects -- switched to Entyvio after a flare which worked for a while then failed, tried Skyrizi but I think I'm a primary non-responder. Consulted several GI docs and many feel I should keep trying every biologic out there until something sticks, a few agree with me ""well, you did so well on 6MP, let's put you back on that and stop playing the biologic roulette waiting game."" 

Either way I'm looking at a minimum of another 4-6 months on prednisone (10-15mg is as low as I can go without needing a hospital), potentially another year or longer. Getting hard to believe there's an end to this tunnel! Anyone else been on it 2-3+ years and managed to get off eventually?

414,Skyrizi,"Recent (re) diagnosis, changing times?","**note to say I know I’ve been relatively irresponsible so no need to tell me that!!**

Sorry for the long post but some background:

I was diagnosed with ileal Crohn’s disease when I was 20 in 2006/2007, I’m currently 39. Way back then, I went on prednisone for the inflammation and then a few other mild drugs for maintenance. Had a major flare up around 2013 ish and had a colonoscopy and I think went back on prednisone and then pentasa for maintence. Pentasa was a major pain (and probably ineffective) cuz if I recall, I had to take like 2 pills, 3x a day. I basically just stopped taking it completely by 2018 and have been on nothing since. 

Over the years, I’ve had a few mild symptoms that would last a day or two (cramping generally) that related to something I ate or stress but always went away. I left the country and moved back to the US a few years ago but haven’t had a gastroenterologist since, so recently decided to find one.  Since I hadn’t had a colonoscopy since 2013, I just had a endoscopy and colonoscopy last week and despite having few/little symptoms, the Dr did find active inflammation consistent with moderate ileal crohns. Not too surprising but I was hoping none since I have fairly mild symptoms (again, some cramping or nausea once every 5 ish months?). Naive I guess!

Sounds like he wants to put me on a bio drug like skyrizi. I’ll get a Ct scan as well so I’m not sure if he’ll also want to do surgery? Anyway, whole point of this post… 15 years ago, humeira and remicade were the only biodrug options and viewed as last resort. So wanting to put me on a drug I have to take forever (or at least til it’s ineffective ) seems scary. 

Are the bio drugs now the first line of defense? Are they now the standard treatment options for newly diagnosed patients vs last resort??

415,Skyrizi,Has anyone experienced rapid worsening after a period of improvement on a new drug?,"Hey yall, 

So I started Skyrizi in early April and although it took until my second infusion to start seeing any improvement, I had been seeing consistent, small signs of improvement since mid-May. 

However, I had my third Skyrizi infusion two weeks ago today, and that was awful because it took the nurse two hours to find a vein, which was painful and a little traumatic but the important part is eventually a vein was found. Normally I would be feeling a lot better after an infusion, but start about three days (Sunday) after that infusion I’ve actually been feeling worse. My urgency is back, I’ve been having liquid diarrhea on and off, and I’m bleeding again when I go. 

I can’t figure out what would have caused this, other than maybe the medicine wasn’t correctly absorbed by my veins, which doesn’t seem very likely. I haven’t traveled anywhere, been under any unusual stress, or eaten anything that would cause an almost two-week episode that I can think of. 

Does this mean the Skyrizi is no longer working? I was so encouraged by the early results I’ll be brokenhearted if it’s stopped working already, although it does seem quite soon for the situation to shift so rapidly. 

In addition, I got bloodwork back and my CRP was about 43 in March and is now 51.

417,Skyrizi,Colonoscopy showed mild inflammation after 5+ months - failing Remicade. What's next? How long should I expect?,"Subject pretty much says it all. I've been flaring since around November when I stopped taking Imuran in combination with Inflectra. They tried putting me back onto the Imuran in February and giving it a few months to start working but it's pretty clear something is no longer functioning. My GI said we'd need to switch treatments and could discuss that in a few days when she has availability.

Is Skyrizi next up? It wasn't even an option when I'd started the Remicade/Imuran 8+ years ago, so I'm kinda hopeful it can do a better job even though they both got me into deep remission (until I stopped the Imuran when a former GI suggested that could be ok).

How long should I expect to go through all this until I'm in remission? It's been too long already. Thankfully my symptoms are very mild but I've gotten all sorts of skin issues (warts, shingles) and other infections while waiting to get better with my IBD.

My husband and I went to Toronto yesterday for a concert. We stopped and got dim sim for lunch before checking into our hotel. I was in the hotel an hour before I started to get pains and cramps and the sat o the toilet for about 1/2 hr/ my husband had to go hunting for Imodium so that we could go out that night. I was hoping to have a nice meal and a drink or two before the concert. Fat chance. 
I’ve been looking toward to this weekend for ages, and this fucking disease ruined it. I still went to the concert and had a good time but my stomach was on my mind the whole time. I kept going for ‘in case’ toilet breaks during the concert.
I’m going on vacation next week and dreading this ruining it. 

Update: I haven’t had a bad flare in a while so I guess I got complacent lol

Got home yesterday, went to take my skyrizi injection- unit failed- wouldn’t inject the drug. 
I’ll now need to try and get a replacement before Thursday when I leave for the airport.

439,Skyrizi,Dual biologics: Does anything change?,"Am about to add Remsima, a newer biosimilar of Remicade, to the Skyrizi that I have been taking for ~2 years.

Does anything change wrt daily life, extra precautions, medical follow ups? Are there any funny little quirks involved, such as having to inject the two medications in different locations, or needing to avoid the sun, or some such? 

Does this tell me anything about how my Crohn’s disease status is viewed (am I probably considered a severe case now, for example)? I assume that goes without saying! But I’ve never been told outright.

Are there assumed or potential long-term implications of being a person prescribed dual biologic therapy wrt expected disease course, likelihood of needing a stoma, maybe quality of life such as needing to stop working at some point?

I do better when I have information but I’m a bit short on energy to handle this how I normally would (reading All The Things).

454,Skyrizi,"Flare Since October, Hospitalized, and Feeling Hopeless—Any Advice?","Hi everyone,

I’ve been in a really bad flare since October and was hospitalized from November 28 to December 2. I’m currently on prednisone 40 mg (been a month) and finishing my last induction dose of Skyrizi on December 24. While in the hospital, I was on antibiotics (IV and oral), but things still feel like they’re spiraling out of control.

I’ve lost 10 pounds, and my hemoglobin is down to 8. I get better for a moment, and then it feels like hell breaks loose again. The bleeding and pain just won’t stop. A couple of days ago, I ate a pork chop (trying to help with my anemia since I’m also on my period), and it triggered the worst bleeding I’ve had yet. I don’t even know if diet matters for Crohn’s because everyone says it doesn’t, but I’m already on a super restrictive diet.

The hospital discharged me saying there wasn’t much more they could do and that I should heal at home. They didn’t want to give me a blood transfusion because I’m young and will “probably” be okay with iron infusions, and that the steps are to wait until Skyrizi kicks in. But I feel so weak and defeated

Apparently, my MRI shows improvement (severe to mild inflammation), but it doesn’t feel like it. I’m in so much pain, and the bleeding just won’t stop. I’m losing hope and don’t know what else to do.

Has anyone else been through something like this? How do you manage the bleeding, pain, and anemia? I feel so stuck

Thank you for reading.

My GI immediately switched me to Skyrizi and I am having terrible reactions after my second loading dose. After speaking with the doctor yesterday, I was basically left with the answer that I can choose whether to continue Skyrizi or move on to the next biologic drug. She told me ""once that bridge is burned, there's no going back"" which I did not think was true since I have seen plenty of stories of people going back to a biologic after stopping it for some time. My blood work came back totally fine with Avsola, it was just the fistula becoming active again that was my doctors sign to switch me onto a new drug.

464,Skyrizi,"Hospital day 6, still no clear answers, GI and surgeon are on different pages. Any help please? ","After a year of different drs, tests and hospital trips, I was finally diagnosed with Crohn’s in September. It only affects a small portion of my ileum, but that section is really bad, in Sept I was told the stricture was at least 50% narrowed and dr wanted to do 6 months Skyrizi and repeat scope to see if it opened up any or if I would need surgery. I had my first infusion Oct 9th, but have been going down hill since. Starting Sunday Oct 20th I started getting extremely sick, couldn’t eat, pain and nausea all day. Extreme bloating. Went to ER the 22nd, was told it was a flare, got fluids, sent home with pain meds and steroids and Zofran. No improvement for days, and BM’s completely stopped as of the 23rd. Talked to dr several times and told to do Miralax/Dulcolax combo, was constipation due to pain meds. This continued until the 29th, finally so weak and dizzy, nauseous and in pain dr told me to come back to hospital. So I was admitted that day and I’ve been here since. Had the clear liquid diet for 3 days, hardly any movements still. Now dr moved me up to full liquids yesterday and after just a few bites the severe pain and bloating set in. 

Sorry this has been so long, but here’s the rundown of what I’ve learned since I’ve been here.
Surgery is a definite now, as the stricture has narrowed even more, said it’s barely open. I’ve had consults with GI and surgery every day since I’ve been here. Surgeon wants me to go home on steroids for 30 days, pretty much strict liquid diet and then do surgery. GI doesn’t want me leaving the hospital until I have surgery but stated he obviously can’t keep me here for a month. But I’m still struggling even with too much liquids, steroids aren’t doing anything. Still needing Zofran daily, bloating like crazy after liquids, and hardly any BM’s still. GI says I’m partially obstructed and the only thing that is going to help me is surgery.

So the battle is between the surgeon and the GI and I feel stuck in the middle. I understand both of their viewpoints, but I’m struggling day to day. Any advice or suggestions on what I can do at this point?

466,Skyrizi,"Crohn's, Health Anxiety and Acceptance","I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease when I was 19. I'm now 27 and have exhausted all the biologic options except for Skyrizi which I'm currently on. My Crohn's is severe and over the years I've become quite depressed, anxious and dissociated. This isn't helped by the many steroid courses we have to go through over our life. I've been on maybe 5 or so now? I can't even remember. The last 8 years have been a blur and my memory is complete shit. 

Now I'm on this last option before surgery will be considered. Rinvoq didn't work, which honestly hurt me so much mentally. I had high hopes for it and it seems like a miracle drug. Your body can't build antibodies to it and for the first time in years, I wasn't itching. It kind of worked at 45mg but after that it stopped. It's baffling.

After that, ended up in hospital for 2 weeks, started a new diet (CDED) and Skyrizi. And of course, steroids, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. What followed was 2 months of hell that still hasn't ended. I started developing issues like tingling in my back, joint pains and many others. Wrist issues had me terrified I wouldn't be able to go on my computer again. Which is important to me as a passionate electronic music producer. I spent so long being anxious about it, googling the antibiotics, googling steroids, googling, googling, googling. The steroids didn't help. Massively increased cortisol levels combined with this awful situation. It's been the darkest period of my life. I didn't think it was even possible to be this level of anxious and depressed.

I'm off the steroids now, but the health anxiety hasn't left. I still get joint pains, I still get the occasional tingling, and now as I've come off the steroids. My allergies have returned in the form of itchy skin, occasional blocked nose and itchy eyes. Could be and allergic reaction to the Skyrizi, could be the Crohn's, could be my body building antibodies to Skyrizi. Could be so many things. I google, and google. Nothing comes of it. Doctors in UK give me appointments for 2025. 

I miss my life so much. Making music, playing games, watching anime, going on summer walks listening to my favourite music and feeling like life is beautiful. 

Here I am now. My Crohn's is in 'remission' (toilet 3 times a day, a little urgency and some diarrhoea but it's better than my flare ups of going 10+ times a day). I'm eating more healthy than ever on this new diet after spending my life having junk food. I'm exercising. And yet, I'm more depressed than ever. I've developed severe health anxiety, I have allergies, itchy skin, joint pains, low energy, I wake up twice a night to go pee, I'm extremely depersonalized/derealized. 

I think about my past and how much I miss feeling alive. I think about my future and how scared I am of when the Skyrizi inevitably stops working. I'm stuck in this now of persistent itching. So I google. What comes of it? Feeding my health anxiety. 

I miss focusing on life and just making the most of my remission periods. I feel incapable of doing that after this recent steroid course. I'm so terrified and I want to be healthy. I don't want to flare up, I don't want to itch. I don't want joint pains. I don't want to make the people around me sad with my crying and venting. I don't want to feel so fucking depersonalized all the time. I want to fucking feel alive. Life truly is so beautiful and I just want to be able to do the things I love without suffering and worrying about health issues all the time.

What can we really do? I'm sure I'm not the only one that has more health issues than just Crohn's. I'm sure many of us have skin issues, joint issues. There's only so much we can do about it all and becoming obsessed trying to fix it just means you aren't living. 

Acceptance. Is anyone able to do it? Are any of you happy despite all these issues that plague us? I feel like it's the only way. We're trapped in our unfortunate bodies and so all we can really do is accept it. But then I feel the itching and I think, can I really accept this? Then I get some diarrhoea and I become terrified and think, ""Why should I even exercise? Why try so hard. I'm going to be ill again soon."" 

I want it to end. I want to be dead and at the same time I want to be alive so bad. Fuck man",2024-10-30 13:10:47,CrohnsDisease,15,1gfm5fr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1gfm5fr/crohns_health_anxiety_and_acceptance/,2024-10-30

476,Skyrizi,Y'all think I'ma get skinny? 👀,"For the longest time I couldn't gain weight for the life of me. I was flat tummy and perfect lil bod until about 2022. I had a wild ride. Back to back perianal abscess tried to kill me. I was hospitalized three times in less than a year. Like 8 surgeries. Steroids. The whole shabang.

And then it happened, I started putting on weight. And I couldn't stop. No, I don't think it was the steroids. But in less than a year I jumped 30 pounds. I saw nutritionist. I tried to be mindful of intake. I got a little more than I was hoping for. Well I have been maintaining 160/165 since 2023. It's ghetto.

I grew a nice set of tits but I also look like I'm 20 weeks pregnant all the time. If I get a gas bubble and I run my stomach, at least 1 person is asking if I am pregnant. No, I am not. Perfectly round belly. 

The point is, I have been aggressively denying a stoma. They keep letting me slide. I have an MRI and a double balloon colonoscopy coming up. The last 3 colonoscopies have failed bc the stricture is so tight they can't pass a camera to see a damn thing. 

Well they said that if I am not magically cured of Crohn's after 6 months of Skyrizi... I have to cave and get the surgery.  I hope it's not a stoma. I will settle for a resection. But y'all...

Do you think if they cut out my stricture I'll get my lil flat tummy again? All the bloat just disappeared. The weight just falls off 😩

478,Skyrizi,Skyrizi has stopped working ,"I’ve been on skyrizj for crohns for the last 18 months, and have been in remission! A little backstory - I was diagnosed in 2018 at age 34. I started on mezavant , then went through Entyvio, remicade, sterllera, Humaira (am I missing any??). The day after my meeting with colorectal surgeon to go ahead with ostomy surgery , skyrizi was approved in Canada , and my dr asked if I wanted to try it before doing surgery. I said yes, and thankfully it worked! 
Jump ahead tk 4 weeks ago, I suddenly became symptomatic again. I was given a “rescue dose” of skyrizi, but no improvement. Now I’m back on pred , and they’re going to try one more dose of skyrizi before calling it quits. 
I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else? Did the extra doses help you?? Rinvoq has since been approved here in Canada, so I still have one more option , but I’ve been hearing such mixed things. 
I’m not feeling ready to commit to surgery , but I also can’t live sick anymore! This disease sucks. ",2024-09-28 10:47:09,CrohnsDisease,7,1frbm39,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1frbm39/skyrizi_has_stopped_working/,2024-09-28

I started skyrizi three months ago by the second infusion i felt so great for a week i ate whatever i wanted then my stomach got messed up from not pacing myself, granted i was being bad and not caring about my food journal. 

I’m now on my first on the body shot and my body hasn’t snapped back to that place where i can eat how i was even before i messed up, im having to eat super strict again. Does this mean im failing or was it a good sign that i was able to eat ok for a week and i over did it? 

Also when do i start introducing foods back in ? Do i have to wait until im fully in remission or? I do have a journal but right now what i can’t eat is extensive 

Has anyone else messed up like this before ? I was eating out for every meal like i couldn’t stop and i thought i was ok because for a week i didn’t feel anything ",2024-09-27 02:27:43,CrohnsDisease,6,1fqdjh7,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1fqdjh7/skyrizi_users/,2024-09-27
480,Skyrizi,Help: Surgery or Rinvoq?,"I 26F have had crohns sinds i was 12.
The last 10 years have been awfull because of exhaustion and the last 5years have been an absolute nightmare.
My main symptom is fatigue which is horrible right now.
(I work 2hours a day and then i need to sleep for 1,5 hour just to cook dinner. And in the weekends i just rest. So i am sleeping through my life.)

To keep it short:
When i was 14 - 15 i had remicade which worked wonders however back then it was decided to stop because most symptoms were gone (big mistake, exhaustion came back and was not allowed to restart).
At 18 the crohns was bad enough (fistula) to restart but then the effect it had was minimal and then stopped all together.
After that i had all other biologicals on the marked. All of which worked for max 1 year to then stop working.

I now use Skyrizi, which according to the endoscopie is doing a good job at keeping my intestines in check.
Except for a small area between the small and large intestine which is looking bad with ulcerations etc accoring to my doctor.

Now i need to make a decision:
Remove that part of my intestines.
Or
Start the only medication i have not tried yet : Rinvoq.

I am struggeling because my doctor actually said in a past visit that operating is basically not an option because my crohns is quite literally from mouth to butt.
So the succes rate is quite low with a high chance of it returning.
Also i have never had any strictures or anything like that and that is a risk with the surgery.

But if i choose Rinvoq, it may not work.
And restarting Skyrizi will most likely fail just like my other attempts of restarting.
And then i have no more options medication wise...

So yeah, i am kind of stuck...

What would you do?
And what has been your experience with surgery of Rinvoq?
And what effect did it have on your fatigue?

483,Skyrizi,Anyone else had a similar experience? Could it be a simple flare or might it be more?,"Hiii i've been on skyrizi for almost a year now. It's been working great and my quality of life was much better. Inflammation went down and symptoms were much better. But so for the past week i've been having 5/6/7 bristol stool chart at least 3-7 times a day sometimes more. I took immodium wednesday (my GI doc says I can take it) and I felt better. Then more 5/6/7. Friday night I took immodium again because I was so over going so much to the bathroom. Saturday woke up had 5/6 type 2-3 times and had my day normally. In the evening I was EXTRA bloated felt very nauseous. Had 7 bristol stool chart types a few times. Then started throwing up liquid v*mit, twice in a row then more type 7 diarrhea at least 5-6 times. I was so bloated and felt pressure in my abdomen. Then Sunday I felt better, and was constipated all day. I had 2 poops type 4 before bed. Today I wake up feel better a bit nausea but not too bad and I had type 5/6 all morning and now it's 7 (liquid af) non stop since this afternoon. Like it comes out of me liquid liquid. I don't know what's going on. I had bloodwork done, my white cells are a bit high and liver enzymes too. Left a message at the gastroenterologist's office. I also have a entero-MRI scan planned next Monday it was scheduled before everything started to perhaps flare this week? 

Basically my question is to all of you other crohnies out there, does that sound like a flare to you from your experiences? Or could it be something more?

486,Skyrizi,First flair after 12 years of remission - scared of new drugs Dr is pushing,"Hi friends. 

I've been through a journey with my crohns: dozens of hospitalizations, surgery to remove half my colon and seemingly every IBD medication under the sun. That said, I feel extremely lucky to have had 12 years of basically being disease free. 

I am now starting to flair up just weeks before my first child comes (I’m the dad), and I am terrified given the horrible reality I faced in my late teens and early twenties. I have spent the last 12 years taking Apriso, Balsalazide and 10mg/kg of Remicade every 8 weeks.  It has kept me in great form, but now it stopped working and I am getting sick again.   
  
I am not exactly sure why I am posting, but hoping for some comfort from the community and if you all have any tips or experience with these new drugs.

My doctor wants me to consider one of the following three: 

Skyrizi (Dr Preference)  
Stellera  
Rianvoq 

Thank you to everyone here and wishing strength and health to you all.

487,Skyrizi,New CD diagnosis and increasing family issues,"I am just here to kind of vent and maybe get a little reassurance that I'm not ""crazy/selfish/negative"" as my mom likes to tell me. I am a 25yo female. My mother has been increasingly controlling as I have gotten older. She convinced me to move back home in June 2023 to both study and figure out my health and that they would support me. Growing up and even through my earlier 20s, any possibly concerning symptoms my mother would tell me not to mention them to the doctors because they were just ""normal"" things everyone has, that the doctors would just prescribe me additional medicatios or referrals that would be useless and cost more money. So I never told my doctors I had lots of mucous in my stools and urgency, the inconsistent back and forth cycle of diarrhea and constipation. I never told them about the joint pains I've had in my knees/shins, elbows and hands/wrists. As well as a few other things until recently, because I started to realize as the doctors asked questions, these things weren't normal!!!

For the past 6-7yrs I have been going through all of these weird symptoms including severe eczema and rashes on my scalp, chest, armpits, back, legs, face, and hands. I would also get random appearing cuts under my eyes, corners of my mouth, behind my ears, and at the base of my earlobes causing them to separate a few centimeters from my head (incredibly painful). All of which eventually resolved after 2-3yrs with no idea what the cause was and with no help of any meds or ointments. For the past 4-5yrs, I have had persistent DEEP cuts at the base of my gums, in-between my gums and cheeks. They were so incredibly painful 24/7. They never once went away, and still havent, so I've basically had these open wounds with no idea or inkling what could be the cause. Infact they would get so swollen my face would look like a chipmunk, it was very detrimental to my physcial and mental health because i was in so much pain and felt so insecure. In 2021, my dentist took a biopsy and it just showed granulatomous Inflammation  with large cells...this lead us no where. I tried an elimination diet to see if anything affected me or made my cuts get worse or better. I noticed some of my favorite foods, anything citrus or acidic and anything with a lot of sugar, made things worse and more painful. So I stopped eating those things all together. But the lesions still persisted, then in 2023/2024 I started eating those food again and none of them had any effect, they had no cause or effect on my symptoms. 

I was finally referred to GI, Rheumatology, and Dermatology by my PCP in between 2023-2024. Rheum and GI wanted me to go to Mayo Clinic, because what I had was clearly very ODD and out of the norm, none of them had ever seen what I had and my symptoms weren't revealing to any obvious condition. I first saw a head and neck surgeon at Mayo Clinic in May 2024, after reading my chart and seeing me he told me he is pretty sure what I have is something autoimmune in etiology, so he referred me to several other doctors at Mayo: Derm, Rheum, and Immunology. I first saw the Dermatologist and he immediately told me what I have it is very likely Orofacial Granulomatosis - but he thought it may be a rare presentation of Crohns Disease given some lf my other symptoms and with my primary or obvious symptom being lesions in my mouth. So the Dermatologist referred me to a GI at Mayo and back to the head and neck surgeon to take biopsies of my mouth. The mouth biopsies showed Orofacial Granilomatosis possibly Crohns Disease. GI performed a dual procedure with EGD and Colonoscopy. EGD showed mild Inflammation and chronic active Astral and fundic gastritis. Colonoscopy showed noncaseating epithelioid granulomas and mild-moderate Inflammation with chronic active colitis and proctitis in my ileum,  colon and rectum. All of this is consistent with active Crohns disease especially give my symptoms, elevated calcoprotein, several elevated Inflammation markers, low vitamin B6, and elevated IBD Serology panel. 

None of this convinced my mom I had Crohns! She at one point told me they were just trying to make money off all the tests an procedures they put me through, when that how Crohns has to be diagnosed!!!! She tells me I've been lying and making up symptoms so that they could give me a diagnosis, because supposedly according to her I am just try to find something wrong. As kf my symptoms and pain werent eveidence enough that something is clearly wrong. But through all of this, I stopped talking to her about all my symptoms with her because she tells me they're normal, so she's talking as if she knows the ins and outs of every second of my life. 
I was so worried about having arthritis especially after CD diagnosis because of my joint pains. When I saw rheumatology and revealed my concerns she had me do a few in office stretches/tests showing I have hypermobile joints. I have had these joint pains pains for as long as I can remember, since childhood. If I had known this sooner I could have been doing exercises to strengthen my joints!! There are just so many things, and when I was undergoing the testing and diagnosing process, I of course was doing my research.  But through everything she tells me I'm being negative, I'm just seeing the worst, ""YOU JUST WANT TO PUT A LABEL ON IT, you and you generation just have to find something wrong and always have to put a label on everything""....well fuck yeah you best bet, how else am I supposed to know what it is and how to treat it!?!?!?!?!?

My mother has been causing so much added stress that not only doesn't help my mental health, but worsens my condition! Where I should only be stressing or worrying about my health and applications, she is causing so much other additional stress which has been affecting my sleep, mental health, relationships with my family, and just the kind of person I am in general. My sister accidentally told my mom, during a conversation about my sisters friend that has been suicidal and his family not noticing it, that I had kind of severe depression where I had thoughts of death and anxiety. My sister revealed this in a heated moment basically in a point showing my mom not even she realizes when her children are going through depression...my mom then proceeded to yelled at me telling me I was pathetic, I was just trying to get attention/sympathy, and other people have it worse. She has also told me in the past several months that I am just over exaggerating my situation to get sympathy for my brother and dad, awhile whenever she talks to my sister she tells her that she doesn't understand what I am going through and my sister needs to be more understanding and there for me and my health issues. My sister has been the only one I can turn to, talk about everything with, she is the only one I TRUST. 

Oh also my brother was diagnosed with UC in high school and his is very mild and very well controlled on mesalamine. Recently, my mom told me I am not acting as an adult should and I need to stop being so ""negative"" about my diagnosis - which my being ""negative"" is really just me being informed, realistic, and keeping my own health stuff to my self since she clearly does understand or doesnt want to. She proceeds to tell me the way my brother delt with and acted when he was first diagnosed was okay because he was a teenager in high school. But me being a 25yo adult, I have no right to be mad or sad or what she perceives as ""negative"". 

I am and have been in the process of looking for apartments to move out. It is just so difficult given how little I'm paid, I'm  in the midst of studying for the MCAT and applying to medical schools, I'll be needing new health insurance, and my medical bills are starting to pile up. I have come to realize slowly but surely how toxic my relationship with my mother is. She manipulates me and everyone else in my family so that we are almost isolated and have to rely only on her. I just need to bite the bullet, find a new and fitting place to move, everything else will come and fall into place the best it can. I havent started any treatment yet, i am supposed to start my first skyrizi treatment on 8/27. I am just so scared, nervous, and feel so alone, I know the next steps I take will be best for my mental and physical health...it's just gonna be a rough road ahead and I don't want to fall back into old patterns or toxic relationships.

488,Skyrizi,Has anyone had infusion site pain with Skyrizi?,"I just had my second loading dose today. About 15-20 minutes in, it felt like I blew a vein. I called my nurse in and she checked it and flushed it. It worked perfectly fine and the flush felt fine. We thought maybe it was a positioning thing. We re-started and it again starting burning. We started an iv on the other arm. 15-20 minutes in, my vein/arm is on fire. By this time it was nearing the end of the infusion so I just sucked it up but I did let her know at the end. 

No other effects, my first infusion I didn’t have this issue. I felt fine otherwise. The nurse said she hasn’t had anyone else have this issue with Skyrizi. I asked if there’s something they can give me to stop it or lessen it and she said she’d need to phone a friend. 

The only difference between infusions were my nurses and the veins used. This nurse used veins on the top of my forearm while my first infusion was done where my elbow bends. 

I’m about 8 hours post infusion and my arm HURTS. Again, I feel completely fine otherwise.

489,Skyrizi,Remission after resection ,"Hi all!

Just curious how many individuals were able to maintain remission after a resection surgery in the small bowel? I had my 6 month colonoscopy 2 weeks ago and GI doc stated that I was in “deep remission” with no sign of any new or active Crohn’s. I had failed inflectra before I found out I was in remission and doc said that I had 2 choices. I could either continue with a different infusions as a precaution or I could stop infusion right now (since i had failed remicade) and just be monitored every 3 months. I decided to go off infusions right now and just be monitored since my Crohn’s had only been contained in the one spot I had removed. I guess I was just wondering how long others stayed in remission after small bowel resection’s? And if you did, do you regret having not been proactive with infusions? 

Doc said the minute my stool comes back with inflammation we can immediately start me on Skyrizi. I’m fairly recently diagnosed and I’m still learning my body and how to identify what’s not normal outside of my baseline. Right now all I know is my Crohn’s seems to manifest on my skin (i.e. eczema flare ups), my tongue (geographic tongue), and potentially bouts of constipation that are not caused by a stricture (since mine is removed now). However, I’m just slightly concerned I won’t know what’s going on between those 3 months of stool testing.

490,Skyrizi,Skyrizi migraines/tension headaches,"Hey guys,
I’ve been on Skyrizi since May. I’ve had two infusions so far(it was put off because I got hives after the 1st one) . I had my second dose about a week and a half ago. I noticed immediately after the infusions I have a severe migraine. I already suffer with chronic headaches all my life so it’s not unusual but with Skyrizi I’ve been having headaches every single day. Today I have such a horrible migraine I feel as though my head is going to explode and my head will fall off my body( I know that’s not possible but that’s how bad it feels). As I’m typing this my eyes have been red and swollen , this migraine started this morning and nothing has helped. I can’t rest with how bad it is and light is affecting me badly. I take chronic pain killers and none of the doses I’ve taken has helped this either. On top of that I’ve taken additional tylenol( I take Percocet) and that hasn’t touched it. I’m not sure what to do about this. And despite the side effects I’ve had my doctor wants me to continue taking them. It is very hard for me to function lately with the migraines and tension headaches. I can’t focus to drive and I absolutely have to drive bc of my young daughter, now she’s in school so I cannot avoid that. Then just doing daily activities has been more of a chore than it has already been with my IBD symptoms.

And holy shit, I felt like a new man. Great results, except for one weird side-effect which made my doctor completely stop the treatment. 
It turned my ejaculation blue.. no other side effects. Now this alone made them stop the treatment(due to it being an unknown sideffect) and put me on Skyrizi instead, which i havet had good results with so far(still new, just had my first 3 doses at the center to begin with).

496,Skyrizi,Skyrizi and fluid retention?,"Last year, after my Crohn's got worse and brought on issues that put me in the hospital for a week, my GI dr prescribed Skyrizi. It has been a miracle for me and my GI symptoms, but one thing I've noticed since starting it is that I have A LOT of fluid retention all over and I'm wondering if it's because of the Skyrizi?

To backup a little, before going into the hospital, I was on Prednisone off and on to try to get things under control. I had massive foot and leg swelling, which can be normal with Prednisone, but those were the only areas swelling up.

Immediately after starting the Skyrizi loading doses and now with the self-injections, the fluid retention all over is constant. When I mentioned it to my GI dr last year, he didn't think it had anything to do with Skyrizi, but I'm still wondering because it's the only thing, medication wise, that changed.

I'm on Lasix to help control it, but if I miss even a day, which I do a lot because of errands and not wanting to stop every 5 minutes to use the bathroom, the swelling starts right back up as soon as I eat anything.

501,Skyrizi,Weight Gain and Crohnes ,"Hi everyone! First time posting here but just wanted to see if anyone shared this experience. I was first diagnosed with Crohnes around 15 when I got unlucky and somehow got E.coli which kickstarted the Crohnes. I went from around 200 to 145 in about 2 months. Since then they have tried every med possible like the oral pills, shots to my stomach (had to stop that because it would make me throw up everywhere) and eventually to Remicade infusion. I have been on those the past couple of years but with being that there has been weight gain which I know is normal but it hasn’t really stopped and I consistently workout and make sure to eat right. I am now 270lbs and gain about 5lbs every six months. I have tried very low calorie diets and cardio to high protein and lifting weights but I can’t shed any of the weight. They decided to try switching me to Skyrizi which i have my second infusion this month. So far all seems good! This weight gain however is concerning me because I would like to lose weight and have consistently been trying to for 2 years. Any similar experiences? I do have a slower metabolism but I do consistently work out and I am a pretty big guy right now about 6’4 270 and I have been trying to do everything I can to lose weight.

I have less than 20cm of my terminal illium affected according to my latest CT scan and my dissmissive GI docrtor is recommending a pre-emptive surgery saying that new research shows good remission rates in these early cases.

504,Skyrizi,Anxiety &amp; Crohn’s ,Hey all. Diagnosed in March of this year and have been on steroids since March 5th and skyrizi infusions started late April. I went to see my GI a week ago for a follow up and he labeled me as being in clinical remission and started tapering me off my steroids (9mg budesonide -&gt; 6mg). Within two days I noticed I had regressed back to how I felt 2 months ago. Nausea/vomiting and more frequent BMs. My doc decided to go back to the 9mg for now.

505,Skyrizi,Red Patch in Throat after Skyrizi,"Hi everyone, I wanted to check in to see if anyone else has had a similar experience to me about this. 

This is my second dose of skyrizi at home (fifth dose including the initial infusions). The first time I took it at home I developed a red patch on the back left side of my throat, super visibly noticeable and SUPER painful but accompanied by no other symptoms (I don’t feel sick at all, just a painful red patch). I didn’t connect it to skyrizi as I had taken it a few days ago at that time and it wasn’t really In my mind, I thought I had just gotten just a bizarre virus. 

But now it’s the second time I’ve taken Skyrizi at home and 100% same thing happened. A few days after my injection I developed a red patch in the same exact spot, super painful, no other symptoms and no sick feeling otherwise. Now that there’s more of a common denominator, I’m a little suspicious of Skyrizi. It may have just been a fluke, but every symptom is completely the same and it’s a type of sore throat I’ve never experienced before this. 

Has anyone else had something like this happen to them? I reached out to my gastroenterologist but he usually takes a few days to respond and it’s Friday. It’s super annoying as I work in medical billing so talking is an integral part of my job, but doing so is incredibly painful so I’ve had to call out. Last time this lasted about a week and I even stopped at the ER thinking I had an abscess (I didn’t), currently I’m on day 2 of this sore throat.

Any thoughts?",2024-06-14 15:59:08,CrohnsDisease,3,1dfu9q5,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dfu9q5/red_patch_in_throat_after_skyrizi/,2024-06-14
506,Skyrizi,Rant about being in remission,"Felt like sharing my Crohn's disease story and rant a little. I got diagnosed when I was 10 years old. The disease was always pretty calm, until I started studying. From 2017 on it got only worse and worse and my health deteriorated. From 18 on I stopped visiting a gastroenterologist, since the visits to the doctor in the years before were the only moments I actually felt like I was sick. (Don't do that, very stupid) Due to that I didn't realize how bad the disease has actually become in the mean time. Last summer, I weighed only 45kg/99lbs at a height of 185cm/6'1"". In the time before and after last summer I went through all the therapies, participated in medical studies, had unsuccessful surgeries, received a chemo drug that has probably left me infertile forever, tried nutritional therapies, and so on. Nothing really helped. I cried a lot during that time. Sometimes out of frustration, but mostly out of joy. Joy over how many people helped me and with what ease they did it. Family, friends, and even hospital staff often went above and beyond their professional duties.

Then, last October, Skyrizi was finally released onto the German market. And it showed results. I got better little by little, had surgery this spring where six stenoses in my small intestine were removed, and I was back in the middle of life. And instead of being happy, I feel only frustration. I feel left behind. All my friends around me have had so many experiences during that time, and I'm standing there with my wreckage of a life. Unable to be independent at an age when I wanted to be independent. Afraid of re-entering life with a disease that will always accompany me, with a chance of breaking out again nullifying all the progress I made. Guilty that the physical and emotional work others put into me might have been in vain because I can't manage to make something out of it. Being sick was so much easier than being healthy to me.

The problem is that Skyrizi can take months to improve symptoms so I'm thinking of asking if I can get more prednisone as 30mg/day would only last me 15 more days (or less if I had to taper off of it). Do the positive effects of prednisone continue for a while even after you stop taking it?

The third infusion had to be stopped for the allergy pill to take effect and I had to wait around after because my blood pressure went way up. They did say blood pressure normally drops so that was an unusual reaction.

My question is, are reactions worse with the faster injection rate on the OBI?

513,Skyrizi,Infusions costly after copay assistance - How much are your infusions?,"I was planning on being on Skyrizi all year and chose an insurance plan that had $0 copay. It stopped working.

The generic Remicade copay assistance only covers the medication (not infusion costs) and my entire deductible was applied to my infusion. None of it went to the medication. So my bill is much higher than expected. I guess I'm just unlucky the claim processed with the full deductible on just the infusion and not the medication.  :(

It looks like the actual infusion cost is about $1200 and next infusion I'll owe about $400. Does anyone know how much they are paying/being charged for the actual infusion cost? 

If this medication gets me in remission I'm going to look for a cheaper place to get my infusions next year but my plan doesn't have many choices in my area.

515,Skyrizi,Med free/diet management?,"Diagnosed with Crohn's about 8 months ago now. Progressed slowly over the last 8 months from ""super mild"" to ""mild"" according to my last scope. I had a follow-up with my GI today where she said that the mesalamine isn't working (shocker) so to stop taking it. And since I'm so mild for now, she set me up with the practice's dietician and said, if I choose, I can try to manage this with diet for the time being. Or, if I choose, I can start a biologic (she would choose Skyrizi if my insurance approves it, which is unlikely) immediately instead. For context, I also have arthritis. I'm 28F.

Be real, am I fooling myself here? I like food. I particularly like gluten, lol. When I first got diagnosed, my main treatment goal was to be able to eat pizza again without pain. But, seriously, I'll give it all up if it means I can manage this crap without medication, as that sounds really ideal. Does anyone actually manage their Crohn's just with diet?

516,Skyrizi,Experience with a pain management doctor for EIM,"Feeling really sick of the same bs with the healthcare system. I’m feeling beaten up and tired and could really use a little support or ideas.

I’ve had a frustrating course of my disease, but finally my GI symptoms are mostly getting under control. I’m so, SO grateful after multiple hospitalizations and procedures that I’m on skyrizi and about to do my first OBI treatment next week. I can confidently go out for a walk and not be nervous I’ll have to stop in crippling gut pain.

However… I have a strange EIM that appears to be baffling to every doctor I’ve been to. I have cervical lymph node inflammation, along with referred headaches, with no known source — I have had an FNAB, Core Biopsy, and an excisional biopsy (on top of more ultrasounds than I can count) and nothing was shown on any, other than that the tissue sample was a reactive lymph node. I also have inflamed lymph nodes across my armpits and in my abdomen but they are not painful / causing problems atm. As a result, the prevailing theory is that they’re a Crohn’s EIM.

I’ve recently been referred to an ENT (different to the one that did the surgery) and their best guess was that it could be caused by some kind of acid reflux (nasal endoscopy showed a little bit of mucus and irritation which indicates reflux) but thinks it’s unlikely, as well as recommended a pain management doc, basically saying all you can do from here is try a few ‘shot in the dark’ treatments (which I’m down to try!!), try to manage the pain but not the underlying cause, or get *another* biopsy… a real Sophie’s choice.

I’m incredibly frustrated that every doctor I go to refers me to another one, which is 1-2 months before I can get an appointment, and I just have to sit in pain in the meantime. My pain sucks. Sometimes it’s debilitating. It makes me cry, and can take a great day to me stuck in bed. My GI is hesitant to prescribe more opioid painkiller (I’m on Oxy), but I’m not addicted (at least I don’t think I am? It takes me 2.5 months to get through a 10 day prescription) but I don’t understand what they expect me to do? I don’t want to be on the painkiller at ALL but they’re not giving me any better ideas. My thesis is that we should go searching for an alternative, but simply doing nothing in the meantime seems like a pretty garbage solution.

Am I missing something? Should I feel this guilty for being frustrated? What would you do in this situation? How can I get out of this referral-&gt;referral-&gt;referral loop and finally get answers?",2024-03-01 04:22:50,CrohnsDisease,3,1b3lasm,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1b3lasm/experience_with_a_pain_management_doctor_for_eim/,2024-03-01

519,Skyrizi,"Scolded by ER doctor for not taking meds be sent me for crohsn, didn't do anymore test..ended up having a bladder infection","I was scolded by the doctor that saw me the most when I went to the ER the second to last time, I was in and out of the ER every two weeks every month. Now I went in with symptoms that could be crohns related , every other time it was crohns (shaking, fever, cold sweat,  pain, dizzy spells) so I went in.

**So backstory to make it add up**: I was post to have surgery but because I was on skyrizi and steroids they told me I would have to stop for half a year aka 6 months. I tried to stop and thats when the bad spell started.

So he comes in and ask if im taking my meds he said to take, I say no (cause I'm trying to get this surgery and I'm already 10X more likely for shit to go bad!) without letting me explain way he scolds me and says ""there is your reason for being back every week! if you don't take your meds what do you think will happen!"" im sitting there being talked over as I try to explain to him I can't have surgery without stopping all meds that effect my gut....he hears none of it and tells me to take the meds until the surgery and to just make it 6 months out...again can't do that cause I have to be off all gut meds for 6 months...legit was ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I have a fever again,shaking, no pain but feelings off and I go back to the ER, im also feeling sick. After just two hours (I was in there for 5 hours last time) the nurse comes in ""you have a bladder infection we are giving you some antibiotics"" ..the last doctor MISSED the infection, blamed me for the non-crohns attack and made me feel like shit. This isn't the first time the people there fucked me over, I had blood clots in my right arm that ended up traveling to my lungs, only went back to the ER when my father noticed I was breathing heavy (figured I was just fat) ..turns out I was close to death so fun! Turns out (even the doctors and nurses said) that an IV blow out I had ""probably"" caused the blood clots ..it ran half my arm...

522,Skyrizi,Similar Experiences with Obstructions?,"TLDR: On a biologic (Skyrizi) managing Crohn’s to what it appears effectively yet randomly get these obstructions every 3-5 months which result in 12 hours of hell. 

Just got back from a 4 night hospital stay for a small bowel obstruction resolved with bowel rest and daily doses of IV prednisone. Obvious follow ups with GI including colonoscopy to come but scratching my head a bit. 

I get these episodes very frequently about once every 3-5 months for at least the past 5+ years where I start vomiting violently non-stop, inability to pass gas/stool and horrible adominal pain. Sometimes I go to the ER (especially early on since I didn’t know what was happening) other times I ride it out at home knowing I been down this road before. This last time, the pain was worse and vomiting lasted longer that I went to ER and admitted. 

The weird part is, these episodes present itself when I’m feeling completely fine at random. Currently on biologics and managing well (only using washroom once a day/formed). This last episode for example, had one regular formed movement at 5PM before I left work, zero symptoms. By 10PM, hell broke loose. 

Could it be that I have strictures and any tiny small flare in the affected region produces this? Or is it just inflammation that suddenly is triggered and within minutes/hours builds up? I really can’t pinpoint it down either to diet as Id regularly be eating that meal for years and even after these episodes without issue. I’m not sure how much is scar tissue either as I have very minimal discomfort currently after IV prednisone and a CRP down to 1.3 mg/L. My CRP on admission night was only a 7.6 mg/L. 

Just wondering if anyone else had these experiences. Do I have to put up with one absolutely horrendous night every 3-5 months? Or does it seem like something else is underlying here like strictures requiring surgery?",2024-01-16 04:26:36,CrohnsDisease,9,197twsq,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/197twsq/similar_experiences_with_obstructions/,2024-01-16

I failed Remicade after 8 years recently, just got out of the hospital inpatient two days ago after an entire week, and today everyone was really excited because I finally was going to get my first Skyrizi dose, and it was going to be a ‘game changer.’

526,Skyrizi,Resection after Stressful Finals,"Hi guys! I'm currently scheduled to get surgery on Dec. 20th, 2023 to remove a stricture somewhere in my small intestines (probably the terminal ileum). I'm really concerned though for 2 reasons:

1. I had an MRI in August that said my stricture was in the middle of the Jejunum and an MRI in November, which completely contradicted the first MRI and said my stricture was (paraphrasing) ""probably at the terminal ileum"". My surgeon still wants to go ahead with the surgery and I guess figure out while operating where the stricture is, which is pretty scary to me.
2. I have finals this upcoming week, with my last final on Friday. I'm a CS major at a fairly competitive college and avoiding the stress of finals is extremely difficult. My symptoms have recently worsened from the pressure of studying for finals. Generally, I think the less inflammation I have while being operated on, the better so having the surgery 5 days after my finals is also pretty scary

Because of this, I want to try pushing back my surgery to the middle of January or even further back, possibly into my spring semester so that I have time to heal. I also want to get another MRI to clear up the contradiction between the first two. Do yall think this is a good option?

My history: I've had CD since I was 14, but didn't have any abdominal pain at that time and went into remission for a few years after diagnosis. When the abdominal pain part of my Crohn's did flare up, I was 17 and completely unprepared for it. I wasn't told about dieting, or scar tissue building up and I was distracted by a very stressful school environment throughout my last 2 years of high school so I seriously regret not doing more to stop this illness. I went on Remicade and failed that after 6 months, then went on Skyrizi at the start of 2023 which (according to the MRIs) has been effective in reducing inflammation pretty much everywhere but the place I have a stricture (meaning my symptoms are still extremely painful at times). I feel like I've caused my disease to get so bad and that I failed to bring it under control. Getting a stricture after only \~2 years of having abdominal pain is good evidence of that. I know at the end of the day that the damage's been done and I need to get the stricture cut out, but I'm still very scared. I don't wanna potentially have diarrhea or have to rely on dietary supplements for the rest of my life.

548,Rinvoq,RINVOQ stopped my period,"
I’ve been taking Rinvoq since March, and I haven’t had a period since. My cycles have always been a bit irregular, and I might skip a month here and there, but I’ve never gone this long without one. I wasn’t sure if Rinvoq was the cause, so my midwife prescribed progesterone to take for 10 days, saying my period should start afterward.

It’s now been a week and a half since I finished the progesterone, and still no period. I’ve had cramps and all my usual PMS symptoms, but nothing yet. I’ve taken multiple pregnancy tests, and that’s definitely not the issue. I’ve been drinking mugwart tea and taking vitamin C to try to get it started before my trip next week.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on what I can do? Will my period ever come while I’m on Rinvoq?

549,Rinvoq,"“Aggressive” Crohn’s, minimal symptoms?","I’m a young male who was diagnosed a couple years ago.  

Both my GI’s have described my Crohn’s as very aggressive. Yet, I have very little everyday symptoms. The main issue is a fistula that hasn’t healed, even with a seton in place for over a year. Besides that, difficulty gaining weight and bloating with meals is definitely not good, but it’s nowhere near the stories I read on here. My daily quality of life is mostly fine I’d say.

I feel like my doctors aren’t listening and just want me to stay on drugs. They have warned me that stopping my biological will end badly for me. Anyway I’ve switched from Avsola to Rinvoq and those symptoms have gotten better for sure (still waiting on fistula) but the discrepancy between my physical symptoms and their severe diagnosis is alarming.",2025-08-14 14:36:16,CrohnsDisease,1,1mq2g48,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mq2g48/aggressive_crohns_minimal_symptoms/,2025-08-14

I go to my gastro august 5th and just started prednisone to help with my pain, diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, etc. (I told this nurse, not my gastro) last visit how I’m in pain all the time and she prescribed probiotics?!? After a few weeks my symptoms worsened and I lost even more weight (22 pounds in about 2 months). So I asked to get prednisone. So I’m not feeling like myself. I am a walking zombie I feel. I am a 6’3 male who does not feel like himself and it sucks. I can’t sleep, eat, and when I do eat it slides right out of my bum. Prednisone day 3 is today and I hope something changes either the pain gets alleviated, night sweats stop, or I might have to put myself in the hospital because I need to feel better.

563,Rinvoq,I swear the universe hates me 😔,"I was started on Rinvoq 45mg and was essentially in remission. The moment I was dropped to 30mg all of my symptoms came back. So my doctor decided to do a scope. I guess I have C Diff. No clue how long I’ve had it as symptoms align with my usual flare symptoms. My doctor didn’t seem like it was an urgent matter which was frustrating (he’s always been great besides this situation). So he sends in a script for antibiotics but my insurance denied it. I looked on GoodRx thinking maybe I could afford it out of pocket… nope, it was $7k discount. So a week goes by and I hear nothing. My doctor was supposed to send something else in the moment it was rejected. I finally call him and I was able to get vancomycin 125mg x4 a day for two weeks. Not only do antibiotics already make me feel hellish but I cannot take my Rinvoq the whole duration of antibiotics. So I’m struggling so hard right now. I have to set my alarm for every six hours which includes the inconvenience of a 5 am dose. To make matters worse… I’m constantly running to the bathroom at work and since the second bathroom is out of order (it’s been two days and I’m hoping they fix it soon) it’s even worse. I’ve been having to wear depends 24/7 and have a backup in my hoodie pocket just in case I need to change it at work. My urgency is off the charts. I move the wrong way then bam I have to run. I’ve even had accidents just getting up from bed to the bathroom which is super close. What’s weird is I didn’t have many accidents or much diarrhea prior to antibiotics. Also, having to sanitize the bathroom after each trip is exhausting. I just wanted to vent because I just hate my life so much right now. Not to mention my cat has cancer and I’m overwhelmed with school. So I’ve been stressing extra hard which has made my symptoms worse. 

Has anyone had success with this antibiotic? Did you have to stop your crohns medication too? Any tips? 😭",2025-06-16 02:14:45,CrohnsDisease,5,1lchekr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lchekr/i_swear_the_universe_hates_me/,2025-06-16
565,Rinvoq,Is this normal for Crohn’s disease?,"For context I have been taking Rinvoq for about 3 months now, but still experiencing severe abdominal and joint pain. I spoke with my GI about a month ago that I thought I wasn’t in remission. So he sent me to the hospital to potentially get a colonoscopy and steroids if needed. When I arrived they took my blood and everything came back normal. So then after reviewing said bloodwork, my GI told me there was no use in doing anything else because blood didn’t show anything concerning. I was told to keep taking the Rinvoq, see a rheumatologist, and to use up to 4,000 mg of Tylenol to manage pain. 
There was no further imaging or investigation.

Jump to this week, I have been in excruciating pain all over since they discharged me. Worse pain than when I had gotten my original diagnosis of Crohn’s. 
I am always constipated, my joints feel like they are cementing together, sharp stabbing pain in various places, including pelvic pain. It’s especially bad up high in my small intestines and in my liver. I sleep all day long most the time. I’ve been breaking in and out of fevers, and wake up in hot sweats. Not only that but I have passed 2 concerning bowel movements. They are solid but both had a fairly large blood clot connected to them. I am not menstruating, so I know it is not a period clot. But that’s the only way to compare them. It is very concerning, as it’s true my Crohn’s has no history of presenting large blood clots in my stool. 

Is it normal for Crohn’s disease to not get remission on Rinvoq, and for over the counter pain killers (and bentyl) to stop working for pain? If anyone has any advice or even an idea on what to do next let me know. Thanks!

578,Rinvoq,Bad news / advice needed,"Hi, I had a meeting with a liver professor yesterday due to having psc along with crohns. I'm on rinvoq, and have gone through nearly every medicine which have worked to varying degrees but still have what's classed as moderate to severe illness. 

I've been on prednisolone more than off it for about 10 years, my gp has it on repeat prescription for me and I've been taking it to stave off bad flares. 

Anyway, I was advised I must have surgery due to huge cancer risk and all the risks of the medicine, and steroids. 

I've been doing my best to avoid this for so long, I've put up with horrendous pain and exhaustion, mental health issues, urgency, all that stuff. 

He's reccomending surgery, and for it to be permanent to stop the liver disease from getting bad. 

I know loads of people will say have surgery, it's life changing, it's really good etc but for a bit of background as to why it's a really hard decision for me

I have alot of mental health issues including horrendous self esteem and confidence, I already find it incredibly hard to accept people even like me despite whatever anyone says, I am really hard on myself and beat myself up about eherhtbing and have really high expectations and standards for myself. I have diagnosed adhd and autism so a big change like having a colectomy is terrifying to me, I don't know how il cope with the sensory side, thinking everyone is judging me, judging myself, the recovery and actual surgery it's self. 

My partner says she will love me just the same but I don't know if il even be able to accept that or even like myself. 

Can anyone who's had the operation and similar thoughts help me to rationalise it? How do you hide it under clothes? What about being intimate witn your partner, doesn't it just get in the way and kill the mood or are there work arounds or something? 

I'm really overwhelmed and struggling to cope as it is. I do have an appointment with a mental health nurse this week luckily. Thank you ",2025-03-23 10:46:08,CrohnsDisease,3,1jhwjmz,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jhwjmz/bad_news_advice_needed/,2025-03-23

Also during this time my marriage broke down because she claimed I cared more for my family than her and I ended up finding out she had been cheating on me for 2 years. Emotionally I still haven't recovered and physically I haven't recovered even though I am technically doing better. I am able to go to work, but it's hell because I still have 2 fistulas with setons so I have to clean myself at home after a bm because otherwise I won't really be clean.

599,Rinvoq,Positivity Post - because we all need a little bit of this sometimes,"Quick recap of my journey:

2018 first seeing mild crohns symptoms, “infection triggered IBS”.
2020 on prednisone for post Covid asthma flare up and things got a lot better.
2022 rapid decline, diagnosed in December after multiple emergency visits.
2023 failed Mesalazine, Budesonide, Entyvio, Inflectra, oral prednisone. Three long hospital admissions, fcal in the thousands. Far too long on prednisone as every time I stopped I declined so much needed hospitalising again. Horrible side effects, significant hair loss and anxiety, sped up final taper as borderline Cushings.
October 2023 final hospital admission, put on Rinvoq.

2024 has been a journey of relatively stable inflammatory markers, healing colon, but bouts of crohns related arthritis, migraines, low energy, weight gain, medication side effects and really struggled with the depression of it all.

But now, I feel I can finally say things are feeling positive.

I have dropped from 45mg Rinvoq to 15mg. 
My face feels like it’s starting to look like my face again.
I haven’t 💩 myself in over a year. 
I haven’t been admitted to hospital in over a year.
Last week, I closed all my rings every day on my Apple Watch for the first time since 2021. As someone that used to be super active, this was a huge milestone for me.
I managed an overnight hike, I ran 5km (still have to stop for the loo, but I’ll take it), I swam 2km, I biked 40, I might even aim for a triathlon next year.

Even when I was doing mostly really good while on Entyvio. But anyway after a maybe two weeks my liver enzymes were climbing and got to a point that docs thought I should temporarily stop it. I was also on TPN so docs weren’t really sure which could maybe be the culprit. After stopping my enzyme levels started to decline after several days to a week. It took somewhere between a 4-6 weeks to normalize. We then tried it again. Was on it about 2 to 3 weeks, and liver enzymes weee climbing again. Then my muscles started getting very weak and constantly sore, like I worked out way too hard. So basically it caused myositis and we think that the rising liver enzymes were most likely from my muscles, because those same enzymes can come from muscles as well.

622,Rinvoq,Are minor flare up symptoms a sign that Biologic needs to change? ,"Hello fellow Crohnies. I am a 34 year old male, diagnosed for the first time when I was 17.
All these years, my crohn's has never been in complete remission besides the 3 years that I was taking entyvio (vedolizumab I think). Since it stopped working in 2018, I had to take prednisone for nearly 5 years, because I had exhausted all the other Biologics and I didnt want to go for permanent ileostomy. 
So 6 months ago, rinvoq gets approved for crohn's and I started taking it, with surprisingly great results! Everything was going well and I decided to leave Athens (my home town) to work on an island as a waiter during the summer. After about a month at work, I started having symptoms of flare up, so I quit the job and started taking a small mount of prednisone until I can visit my doctors (who are all on vacation right now). 
It surprised me since I was going really well with rinvoq! 
My question is, does this mean that Rinvoq is not working or could it possibly be that I got tired from the job and Greek heat and that it could go back to normal now that I am resting? What is your experience on this matter? 
I am in a very low point because it crosses my mind that I might have caused this by going to work in the summer and I feel guilty.

im currently on the rinvoq loading dose (45mg) and its working really good. Its the first medication that works beside prednisolone. In a few weeks im supposed to go to the maintenance dose of 30mg and im a bit scared that it will stop working or i will get worse again.

does anyone have experience with rinvoq and cannabis? I stopped drinking because of the medication and my crohns and dont plan on starting again. During my worst time with the disease i used cannabis to ease my symptoms.

Are there any interactions between rinvoq and cannabis that you are aware of? I cant find anything online that would suggest it. I did not ask my doc about it yet but i plan on doing so when i have my next appointment in 6 weeks. I doubt that they will make an statement though, because i cant find any studies on it.

629,Rinvoq,"People taking Rinvoq, i need your help!","I have been in a""on and off"" flare since 2,5 years now already. The last ""remission"" started last summer when i was put on Steroids again and then got Sterala at the end of August and has been doing pretty ok until the 1st week of January as I started to work and go to the University after a long time. Within the same week of going back I have started noticing mucus and blood in my stool once again. I panicked and slowed down again to reduce my responsibilities and stress. My stools were ok but covered in mucus and blood a little tho. Then I finally started taking Rinvoq in march or start of april and i got a terrible allergic reacion (that was later proven not to be related to the medication). but i had to wait a while until it was finally my turn to take the test. In the time in between i tried some ""amazing"" holisic diet that made me feel absolutely terrible and with no will to live. The doctors diagnosed me with malnutrition (i am male 187cm and was 58kg). After some time has passed i tried the whole liquid diet perscribed by a doctor and that went terribly! After i was FINALLY able to take the RINVOQ again (we are in june at this point) i have started seeing imediate improvements day by day and i was so THRILLED! Blood and mucus were always still present but at least i went to the bathroom 3-5 times a day. Last week i have had terrible full body chills and fever and lots and lots ob blood and mucus and again uo to 12 bathroom visits. The toilet was bright red again and that made me feel miserable. I am wondering if i got some type of infection that caused this terrible reaction... This week things are starting to improve one baby step at the time so i am a little hopeful again. Finally my question is... how long does it usually take to reach a remission or at least stop seeing the damn blood in the toilet. I am slowly losing hope as I have had to change so many different therapies already and nothing seems to be woring for me or if it does, it does for a very short amount of time.

I'm now back on rinvoq but it's not working and am mad that they could have got me to stop my adhd meds first.

This is the first time in years I have tried to get my small amount of active disease under control with medication and it’s good to feel a positive change in that area.

Unfortunately the side effects are just too much for me. Mainly the lethergy and brain fog, I’m a shell of the person I am on the medication, no energy or desire for anything, finding myself just staring into space. Weird sensation of unreality it’s hard to describe. Making mistakes at work, trying to look after children in this state is very surreal, there’s no way I can keep this up until the three month review to possibly drop down the dose.

My consultant advised to stop Rinvoq, I did ask to drop to the lower dose sooner just to see if things improve for me side effect wise and see if the Rinvoq is effective but that want really considered.

I want to get into remission and be symptom free. This is something I actively want to work towards. Just feeling deflated that this med does its job well but I can’t handle the side effects. :(

Diagnosed December 2022, at which point it wasn’t really bad - I’d say mild to moderate. However failed a bunch of meds meaning diseased quickly progressed to severe.
Was switched to Rinvoq after my third hospital admission in October which seems to have done the trick as have remained relatively stable since finishing steroids in December. Fecal cal normal, a few random fluctuations in certain blood results since, but nothing too concerning. Booked in for a scope in a week and feel they’re likely to say I’m in remission. 
However, I am struggling mentally (and physically!) with this as remission is still quite shit. 
Still having a lot of digestive symptoms and discomfort, always tired, constant skin nail and throat infections, more recently awful joint pain to the point my partner has to help me get undressed at night (I have been referred to a rheumatologist for this). Also gained a tonne of weight that I’m struggling to shift and my periods have stopped.
Is this what I can expect for the rest of my life?! I want my life back. I want to be able to exercise without feeling sick or being in pain.

Well Thursday morning I woke up after going to bed with a lot of stomach cramps and felt really sore and cold and sure enough I was running a low grade fever (100.5). My throat hurt some that day. Then yesterday I woke up with no fever (it broke in the night) but my cough got a lot worse and my lower back (SI joint area) hurt a lot more, and by the late afternoon my fever had returned. I’ve woken up today again with no fever but a much worse cough and nausea and body soreness and I’m guessing my fever will return in the next couple hours. 

I haven’t been able to get in touch with my GI. I stopped my Rinvoq yesterday and will resume it once my GI gives me the go ahead (I’m just too nervous to continue it with my current symptoms).

I’m worried it’s a bacterial infection of some sort because the only other time I exhibited an intermittent fever like this was when I had strep as a kid (fairly sure this is not strep though).

647,Rinvoq,A mystery illness...,"So I started Rinvoq around mid-January.  About a week before that, I got my latest Covid and flu vaccines so I'd be all up to date and hopefully over any side effects before starting the new medication.  Everything seemed to be fine, but not long after starting Rinvoq, I started having some troubling symptoms.  

I'd get spells of dizziness/light-headedness, heart would feel like it was pounding, and I'd feel shaky and have to sit down for a while.  This would happen on and off for maybe an hour or so at a time, 1-3 times a day.  At first, I thought I was just having a hard time recovering after the vaccines because I hadn't slept well in a while, and not sleeping well always messes with me.  Then one of my ears started feeling clogged 24/7 and I got increasingly bad tinnitis.  These things went on for a couple of weeks, then I got a fever which lasted about 4 days.  

By that time I had an appointment with my GI, and I was concerned I might be having side effects from the Rinvoq.  Wasn't sure what else it could be, and had heard similar symptoms were possible.  So they listened to my symptoms, gave me a look over, and did some blood pressure tests.  They said aside from my blood pressure dropping a little upon standing, the only thing they noticed was that my throat seemed red/irritated.  My fever had finally ended and despite the redness I didn't really feel like I had a sore throat, maybe some slight irritation from time to time, so they told me to just keep an eye out and see if anything changed.  Neither of my GI docs thought it was anything to do with the Rinvoq, and they were convinced I'd just caught some kind of virus floating around and had inconvenient timing.  

So I went home, and things seemed to get better over the next week.  Then symptoms started showing up again: mild earache that would come and go, feeling of chest tightness and getting winded when I moved around too much, and a fever that thankfully only lasted one day this time.  Called my GI to report and they told me to go to urgent care for swabs.

Swabs came back negative for covid, flu, and strep.  The people at urgent care also seemed convinced I had just caught something (though no knowing what) and was having trouble fighting it off because of the Rinvoq.  Said my throat still looked red and irritated, but fever was gone by then and vitals were fine.  So they gave me a steroid shot and a 5-day prescription for Prednisone to help me get over it, said if I felt OK I didn't need to take the Prednisone and could take it again if I felt like I needed it.

It's been 2 days and I was still feeling the chest tightness/mildly winded when moving around a lot, so I initially planned to take the full prescribed amount of Prednisone, but it's been causing me so much stomach pain I think it's best if I stop taking it and just see if the symptoms go away on their own.

But I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone had similar experience with symptoms/side effects, and if so, what did it end up being/what helped?  Any insight, advice, or support of any kind would be appreciated right now, really.

2. How did you get your doctor and insurance to support your decision? Are there good articles to show them to convince them this is a good decision?  
  
3. Why did you go in that direction? I personally have extra-intestinal manifestations that are well controlled with Humira but Crohns that is not in remission and needs to get into remission. I'm concerned that my docs will want me to fail on a bunch of biologics before thinking about dual biologics.

165,Humira,switching biologics and extra-intestinal manifestations? ,"Hi all, 

My doc wants me to switch from Humira (really Hadlima) to Remicade (or some biosimilar), due to a lack of mucosal healing in one part of my colon. The majority of the colon is pretty normal, at least endoscopically. We've tried both methotrexate and sulfasalazine to try to get healing in that part of my colon, but it hasn't worked. 

Also: I have several extra-intestinal manifestations of ibd: ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis, and autoimmune hearing loss. I was on Humira until February of this past year, when my insurance made me switch to the Hadlima biosimilar. I think I'm doing a little worse on Hadlima, but it's mostly the same. My AS, uveitis and hearing loss significantly impacted my quality of life before I started Humira in 2009 and I haven't had symptoms since then. So, basically 14-15 years of symptom-free living. The hearing loss problem is a rare one, and can easily cause me to go deaf. 

I recognize that mucosal healing is important to help prevent cancer and surgery in the future. I just also don't want to go hunting for another biologic when the consequences of a flare are so dire for me and my drug is basically doing 80% well. I have symptoms, but they don't really impact my day-to-day life. I sense that, if they sufficiently treat my gut, then the other conditions will be treated as well. I just don't know if there's real clinical evidence of that, or if they're just guessing. 

Anyway, if anyone has any advice or insight in terms of their own experience dealing with extra-intestinal manifestations, please let me know. I don't want cancer, but I also don't want to completely lose my hearing. Thanks.

166,Humira,ISO advice for navigating diagnosis for a newbie,Quick backstory-I had an I&amp;D of anal abscess 2 years ago. 6 months afterwards still having issues of not fully healing I went to a Colorectal surgeon and he found a fistula. 3 surgeries later it seemed to be healing well. A few months after that I realized it was back and went to another doc(moved out of state). She saw the fistula. Had an MRI which showed a small abscess filled with blood and a fistula. Had the procedure to place a seton. She let that sit for a few months and it seemed ready for a LIFT but once she got in there realized the inside was not healed at all so she placed a couple drains-before another attempt at fistula surgery she had me consult with a GI. Since thenI have been diagnosed with Crohns. Although there was inflammation noted in the endoscopic findings there were no indications of crohns from the pathology. My blood work showed my ASCA (IGG) 44.9 H. The bloodwork plus my fistula history and it still not healing is where the diagnosis comes from. I am mainly looking for anyone who has any experience that sounds like mine? Also I am going to talk to her in a couple days and if you think of any questions to ask her I may not have thought of I would appreciate it! She plans to put me on Azathioprine and Humira. And side note I also got diagnosed with EoE during the upper scope and biopsy. I don’t think they are related but that was a surprise diagnosis.

167,Humira,Crohn’s w/ New Pain Onset - MRI Showing Sacroilitis. Experiences/Advice/Hope/Etc?,"Hi friends!

In short, after almost 5 months of debilitating lower back and left butt/leg pain that came out of nowhere, it seems I am finally on my way to getting answers soon (hopefully). I have a follow-up appointment with my Spine PMR doctor on 10/2 but wanted to see if anyone has gone through something similar, if there’s anything I should advocate for, etc. It would also be nice to just have people to relate to as misery loves company.

Timeline/story:

In March of 2022 I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. I’ve been on medication since being diagnosed and am very grateful that I have not yet had any complications, hospitalizations, surgeries, etc related to my Crohn’s so far. This past April, 3 weeks before this pain started, my GI doctor told me that after ~2 years I was finally in remission. Looking back, I wish I cherished those 3 weeks more.

I initially thought this was related to my job change from 12 hour shifts on my feet to a more sedentary desk job. I was convinced it was a herniated disk or spinal stenosis or something like that. My doctor had me try a hip bursa steroid injection to rule in/out bursitis but the injection did nothing for my pain. After 6 total weeks of PT (it took a month to even get seen and then I had a really bad ~1.5 weeks of pain that required my second round of steroids during this journey), my insurance finally allowed me to get an MRI which took over a week to result and prompted my doctor to have me come in urgently to discuss the results (I was panicking at this point because that’s never good). Basically, my first MRI showed “abnormal bone marrow signal” (if you look this up, it could be a variety of things) of my right L4, bilateral sacrum, and left ilium and also said “concern for infiltrative bone marrow process” (if you look it up, it screams cancer). For reference, both of my Crohn’s meds increase my risk for lymphoma, which could manifest in the bones. So it seemed/seems possible. He ordered more MRIs (the first was just of my Lumbar Spine w/out contrast and these additional ones were my Lumbar Spine and Pelvis both w/ and w/out contrast). A few days later, my doctor called me and told me that after discussing my case with Neurosurgery, they want me to get a bone marrow biopsy regardless of what the additional MRIs show (this made me 10x more worried that they were thinking cancer). The impression per the radiologist for the second set of MRIs said ""Findings consistent with IBD related sacroiliitis in this patient with Crohn's disease according to Epic.""

My spine doctor has yet to call/message me about what these new findings mean moving forward so I’m anxious about my follow-up appointment where we’ll discuss the imaging and what’s next. I'm not sure if this would change the plans for or potentially cancel the BMB and Neurosurgery consult that he ordered. It’s been 2 weeks since he ordered the BMB and I still haven’t been able to schedule it as they keep saying it’s still in review. I expect a referral to Rheumatology for further work up but I can’t help but wonder if this is Sacroilitis that’s strictly Crohn's related, Ankylosing Spondylitis (which I had already suspected and my doctor shot down before these additional MRIs), or is there something else it could be?

For reference: 

-I’m on Humira and Azathioprine so I’m confused because if it is autoimmune-related, I find it odd that as soon as I was deemed in remission, this presents itself. Additionally, in theory these meds *could* treat other autoimmune diseases such as AS. So if it is autoimmune, I anticipate having to change/add meds.

-I’ve already tried physical therapy, massage therapy, aquatic therapy (this is the only therapy I can tolerate), a hip bursa steroid injection, aspercreme, heating pads (these still help), ice packs, muscle relaxers, and gabapentin (probably the only reason I can somewhat function but I don’t want to take this forever).

-I do plan on requesting the HLA-B27 lab test for AS.

-Since this pain has started, I’ve also noticed new pains in my left shoulder (I occasionally get tingling down my arm), upper back/neck area, and right posterior rib area that I initially assumed could be from how I sleep or lack of movement but they seem to be present more than not no matter what I do so I’m thinking there’s more to it. I am also more fatigued than I was prior to this, but I blamed it on the pain because being in pain is exhausting.

If you can relate, please share your experience- good and bad. I’m terrified to change meds and risk my Crohn’s remission but I can’t live like this. I briefly looked up options (in addition to immunosuppressants) and saw steroid injections and radio-frequency ablation. I can’t take NSAIDs because of Crohn’s :(

As a recently married 27 year old who wants kids, being in so much pain that I’ve had to use a cane/walker and can barely put on pants sometimes has been extremely humbling and also really disheartening.

169,Humira,Humira wearing off 3-5 days before injection - should I ask Dr about options or wait a few more months?,"hello everyone! I’ve been on humira for two months now and it’s working very well so far exceeeeept it seems to wear off and I have little “flares” about 3-5 days before my next injection date. I know I’ve seen some ppl have to take it more often, but I know two months isn’t very long on it - should I already be talking to my dr about that option or should I give it a bit more time to build up in my system? What have yalls experiences with this been?

fwiw I have moderate ileal crohn’s, pretty ok inflammatory markers (high but not sky high before starting humira), but I also have gastroparesis and am feeding tube dependent and have volume intolerance associated with flares so my ability to get tube nutrition depends on staying in remission lol

(and of course I’m probably going to let both my dr and my humira nurse ambassador both know about this anyway but my GI especially is very hands off, to the point he didn’t even get the prescription for my free replacement pen faxed back to abbvie after ten days and two faxes from them until I gave them a very stern call lol, so I would like to hear other ppl’s experiences and decide how much and how soon I should push them to address this)",2024-09-22 17:20:31,CrohnsDisease,5,1fmygao,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1fmygao/humira_wearing_off_35_days_before_injection/,2024-09-22
170,Humira,Insurance Recommended a Rheumatologist ,"Some Background:
 So, I’ve been pretty happy and stable for the past 10 years but this year insurance decided to take Humira off the formulary. So I’m on Skyrizi. I’ve had a lot more pain, symptoms, and have developed a fatty liver. My numbers look good though. I have PTSD from my first hospital experience 10 years ago and despite 2 years of therapy a couple years back still have a hospital phobia.
Insurance has assigned me a case manager. 

Today:
The case manager said that they think I should get established with a rheumatologist in addition to my gastro. She said that it is standard of care. I do not have any joint issues that I know of, beyond sports injuries.

What is your experience with rheumatology? Is it value added? Particularly if you aren’t seeing them for RA or another joint issue.",2024-09-18 17:20:20,CrohnsDisease,1,1fjybi5,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1fjybi5/insurance_recommended_a_rheumatologist/,2024-09-18

173,Humira,"Hi everyone :) My names caspian. I’m here today to tell you my story. This is a rant post. So, if you have some time to read today, or are interested, please, have at it. I made this post today, to hopefully help at least ONE person out there, who may be able to relate to this. You’re NOT alone. 🖤","I’m only 18 and yet I feel like im 50. No friends, not able to hold a job. I feel so tired and empty. I’ve tried Remicade first, didn’t work. I just started humira 2 weeks ago. So far, the pain i’ve been having everyday for about 2 years now, is just getting worse. Almost 2 years of constant hospitalization from pain so bad, that every single morning I wake up, I feel like i’m being ripped in half. I’m bed bound until my pain meds kick in. They haven’t ever been able to explain to me why it’s always when I wake up in the morning. The pain also comes back almost everytime I eat, unless i’m eating soup. I can’t survive on soup, but id rather do that then be in that kind of pain. Even though I have pain meds now, I still don’t want to be in that kind of pain.. Here’s the craziest thing. I was only diagnosed a month ago, because all of the other times over the last year and a half, even though i was a 16 year old kid, mind you, unfortunately, since there was no evidence of chrons yet, i was left in bed screaming in pain for 10 hours a day every single day, in the hospital for a MONTH. that was, until i either passed out multiple times from the pain, panicked so bad, that my heart rate got so fucking high that i made myself extremely lucid and lethargic, to a point that i forgot how to even talk, or make any noise, and id practically paralyze myself, or! rarely, they came to give me benadryl to knock me out, because they got annoyed with me and came in multiple times, to tell me to be quiet. I was constantly called a liar, a drug addict (and for context, for a short period of time only, i was using pot gummies at the beginning to help curb the pain, or else, as you’ve read, I was bed bound unable to move)the doctors just told me it was all in my head, and that my tests were all fine, so of course! I was fine. Well, It got the point where I almost ended my life 2 times. It was a constant cycle of that. Between suffering like that at the hospital, and then being told I was fine, and then getting discharged and suffering like that at home. I was even diagnosed with medical PTSD. But, let’s come to now. I was in the hospital a month ago for about 2 weeks, and they did a scope, and found all the ulcers. And I. Finally. Got. My. Diagnosis. The ulcers are all throughout both my small and large intestines. But, here’s the thing. Here’s the thing that changed. I met, the most amazing doctor I’d ever seen in my life. Not only did he tell me that he believed me and that he was not ever going to let me down like his co workers did, but he called a pain management clinic for me , and got me an appointment. He also put me on 2 pain medicines. Morphine 15mg in the morning, and Ativan 1mg as needed if the pain comes back later in the day . I also met another amazing doctor, who turns out, is also the medical director. And I got an amazing opportunity to talk to her and tell her about my experience last year and she had fire in her eyes when I told her the names of the people who hurt me so badly. Her and I even had lunch together one day in the hospital and bonded for a while. She told me that she’d love for me to come shadow her and the other doctor at the hospital from time to time, and I jumped at the chance. I plan on being a hospitalist , so it’s a wonderful chance for me to learn and experience new things there. The doctor that gave me ptsd, even showed up to my room and apologized in tears to me. We had a long heartfelt talk . And I told her everything I ever wanted to say. I forgave her, for my healing. But, I didn’t believe the apology for a second. I got my closure there though. But, anyways, For the first time, I felt like I could breathe. I also had an amazing group of nurses. All of them were so supportive and empathetic and I can say I felt like I was truly truly blessed with a moment of peace for once in my life. Got to go home, and things were a little better. At least the pain was managed for the first time in 2 years. But…..then things got worse….I was admitted again 2 weeks ago, for a week, because my pain got so bad, it cut straight through the morphine. But, the good thing was that I had the amazing doctor I met the last time, and he immediately came in and sat next to my bed, held my hand and told me to tell him what’d been going on. He had my back again. They did an X-ray and a CT and turns out I had a little bit of stool blocking my large, intestine, but the place it was stuck at, was RIGHT where I have my biggest ulcer. So that explains the pain being worse. They did a clean out, and just to make sure and be safe, they did a pill camera and said nothings gotten worse, but,, nothings changed and gotten better either. All in all, im greatful to finally have a better connection to a few doctors and nurses there. I’m finally starting to work through my trauma in therapy. But, still, at the same time, I feel like im losing hope. Im just grateful I had 2 amazing doctors who took me seriously, and truly took my pain seriously and put me on 2 different pain medications that work . I can’t wait to go there and shadow them when I start to get things under control. I’m going to become a hospitalist because I want to make sure that I never ever allow another child to suffer the way I did there. I truly want to be the hero to these kids that these 2 doctors were to me. Knowing I changed one life, would make it all worth it. I’m trying to channel my pain into a good career. Doing it wouldn’t only help the children who are suffering from some of those horrible doctors at the hospital, but it would also help heal my trauma and help me to become the hero to children in pain, that I needed 2 years ago. Both doctors were so supportive and thrilled when I told them that I planned to do what they do for a living. And it warmed my heart that they were so happy to ask me to come and shadow with them. I can’t wait to do it. Learning and getting advice from the people I see as my heroes, it just, it means everything to me. And I’m not going to let that opportunity go to waste. I’m going to be the best doctor/nurse practitioner I can be. Everyday I wake up , I’m going to drive myself to be just like both of them . So, I’m fighting, I have no plans on giving up, I just get SO tired of this disease just ruling my life. Somedays im mentally okay, some days I’m worse than I’ve ever been. Somedays I wish I would just peacefully die in my sleep, and some days I get out of bed because i remember what I’m fighting for . *SIGH* well, that’s it. that’s my rant! presenting my life for the past 2 years ladies and gentlemen. 🤌🏽 hahah, anyways, seriously, thank you all for listening to my story. If you stayed till the end , i really appreciate you. And look, i know that I don’t know any of you all personally, but, just know. you are all so strong. Give yourself credit for even getting out of bed in the mornings. Because it’s enough. It. Is. Enough. Keep fighting. Keep on living. One day, it’ll pay off.

174,Humira,Nervous About Starting Humira for Mild Crohn's - Looking for Advice ,"
Hey everyone,

I'm 27 years old and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease about two years ago. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster since then, with multiple doctors and some confusion along the way. One doctor was really pushing for infusions, while another wasn't sure if I had ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's. 

I've been on mesalamine for these past two years, and while it's helped somewhat, I still deal with pain and loose stools pretty regularly. I just had my third colonoscopy, this time with a new doctor. He’s leaning towards a Crohn's diagnosis but mentioned it’s very mild. Now he wants me to start Humira, along with continuing mesalamine.

I’ve been really nervous about starting Humira. I've read a lot of things that have scared me, and honestly, I’ve been putting it off because of this. I’m worried about the side effects and just unsure about what to expect.

I was hoping to hear from anyone who’s been on Humira—what was your experience like? Did you notice any immediate side effects or benefits? How did it affect your daily life? Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm just looking for some reassurance and information from those who have been through it.

Thanks in advance!

175,Humira,Please may it go away.,"I'm on Humira and methotrexate. Have been for a long time. But was on a tapering dose of prednisone too.

I just transitioned from 1mg prednisone a day to 1mg every second day as part of the taper.

And my symptoms are coming back only 3 days in.

I am so fucking tired of this shit. It has been 2 years of things not really working. Now I get to suffer a month before colonoscopy.

And I have to hold down this godforsaken high pressure software development job, while also losing 3 hours and having to catch up on weekends when I need to travel to the rheumatologist for the arthritis

When the arthtitis gets bad, it is excruciating. My back is so painful I can't sit and sleep. Its all coming back now. 

I can't stand the suffering. Thank God I live in a country where I can get codeine prescriptions easily.

The truth is, when two years ago, during my first 6 months of this fucking hell, I made preparations for my suicide in case I could never be fixed. I still have the supplies and documentation.

I was brought up catholic, and while I don't consider myself catholic any more. I enjoyed the idea of each saint having a specialisation. Just before my colonoscopy when they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, I meditated on Saint Jude. Saint Jude is the saint of hopeless cases.

I also bought a necklace with Saint Jude on it. I need to try to find where I put it, because I feel like I am descending into the darkness of hopelessness and the belief that I'm the exception to the rule, and cannot get this under control.

At least pretending saint jude is with me makes me feel less alone. Because no actual human can commiserate with me. Suffering is a lonely experience. ",2024-08-30 10:08:30,CrohnsDisease,9,1f4rl6a,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1f4rl6a/please_may_it_go_away/,2024-08-30
177,Humira,Crohn and relocation,"My spouse has Crohn's disease, thankfully they have been in full remission for a long time and are on Humira.

We are considering to relocate to another country (not sure for how long, could be indefinite if it works out well.). 

We have EU citizenship (currently not living at the EU) and we also have an option to relocate to the U.S. ,and possibly Canada, via their workplace, which will sponsor the process, the visas and also offer an excellent insurance.

Although we have options technically-wise, we are not sure if it is duable to relocate with Crohn, especially when taking an expensive medication. 

Anyone here have been through a similar experience?
Which country of the above, if any, do you think can be a good option? 
Is Canada even an option due to medical inadmissibility in the PR process?

178,Humira,YOU must be your greatest advocate,"So I'm going to tell you my story. It doesn't have a happy ending, or really no ending at all yet, but it almost did. Against all odds, it's still being written...

In June I was trying to figure out my next step as Rinvoq wasn't working and I have now failed Humira, Remicade, Stelara, Skyrizi, Entyvio; pretty much every major popular med. GI was honest with me, its gone beyond his scope and referred me to a crohns specialist in my area. Crohns specialist said no med was gonna help me, that I needed to shut the bowel down and get an ostomy. 

Well, I had been trying that, but the surgeons kept refusing because of my size (I'm 6'1, 500lbs, a beast of a human, but fully functional, not like what you see on TV). Well, he called the best surgeon in the area (who had refused me before) and got him to agree. I had a meeting with the surgeon and the operation was scheduled for July 26th. 

Now, at this time, it was mid-June, and I hadn't pooped in like 8-10 days. It was glorious! As a crohnie, to not have to use the restroom 10 times a day for once? But then it hit 15 days and I was getting worried. By the time it hit 20 days, I went to the ER. They said I just needed to up the laxatives. They couldn't give me enemas because of my stricture. So I went home and did as instructed. On day 25, I called my doctor, and they repeated the same thing. 

Day 31: I'm so sick I can hardly move and the wifey finally had enough and called an ambulance. They arrived, I threw up which I never do, and it had feces in it. I got on the gurney,....

I wake up. I look around, I'm in the hospital. There's a huge tube in my mouth. I go to grab it and I hear a loud beeping. Suddenly a bunch of nurses come in and start talking, calming me down, and after a few, remove the tube. They keep talking to me and I ask if my wife is still there and what happened. They asked me my name, birthdate, and today's date. I got the last one wrong. 

""Sweetie, I'm sorry to tell you, but you've been in a coma. It's been 12 days since you came to the hospital. You've been very very sick."" So as it turns out, I'll skip some of the pageantry: I had to be rushed into emergency surgery where they found my bowels had exploded and filled me with feces. Apparently, that's why I hadn't been pooping. So my entire body was filled to the brim with poop. Being as big as I am actually saved me because it gave my body places to keep putting it. They would spend the next 5 days while I was in a coma taking me back into surgery and essentially hosing me out day after day to get it all. I was told it was between 25-30L of poop, or close to 8lbs someone else said. Not sure how much of that is true, but that's what they said. Sounds like a lot to me. All of this is put together from stories from the surgeons and nurses, etc. 

I had been septic and during the coma my kidneys entered failure, my heart had issues from all the stress and my lungs took on water. I was told no one thought I would make it, and statistically, I shouldn't have. After waking up, nothing on me worked and I was so weak I couldn't hold my phone. Couldn't eat because it was too heavy to lift a fork and couldn't reach my mouth. It was bad. 

Oh and let's not forget from that surgery, I have a wound big enough to sit a bowling ball in. It's 20cm x 15cm x 5cm (yes, 3 inches deep in my gut where you could access all my insides if it wasn't for a thin mesh barrier to help tissue grow back over it) It's HUGE. and next to it, the ileostomy I was supposed to get in a few weeks. 

12 more days in the ICU, tons of meds and antibiotics, and treatment later, I would graduate to a different floor, and 10 days after that I made it to rehab. And that's where I'm writing from now. My bed in rehab. If you all want pics of the wound or ostomy, just say so, I take some every time we redress it. 

I take about 20 pills in the AM now, 15 in the PM, 3 hours of therapy a day, and I have a complication of my left leg not working and no one knows why, so I'm probably gonna be wheelchair-bound until the nerve decides to work again. CT, MRI, ultrasounds, nothing shows anything to explain why nothing south of my knee is functional, so I'm trying to learn how to function without it. Also there's the wound vac on my cannonball hole and the ostomy which I'm learning. 

Now, I didn't tell you this for sympathy, but to warn you about complacency. I just listened because it let me go home and suffer and said ""screw it"". Pain affects your brain and we're all in pain, but you have to push drs when you know something is wrong. Don't just accept the basic answer if your gut tells you something is up. Had I pushed harder when they all said ""Just take more laxatives"" I might not have a wound that you could throw a softball through that will take 6 months to a year to heal. 

Dr.s know more than us most of the time, but we know us better, and if you know something is wrong, you have to be stubborn, be persistent, and keep pushing till you get answers. Don't just ""take laxatives"" and call it a day. 

I'm working every day to get stronger, to recover. I'm pushing myself, and I'm arguing with every doctor i have to get to a logical conclusion and make sure we do everything in all of our powers to see to my rise back into the land of humanity. Please learn from my experience and advocate for yourself. You are your best support. Doctors will have the info, but you need to push sometimes for the answers. And if you do still fall like I did, there's only one thing you can do after, learn from it, push harder, 

and Rise. ",2024-08-18 20:55:56,CrohnsDisease,82,1evjpyu,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1evjpyu/you_must_be_your_greatest_advocate/,2024-08-18
179,Humira,GI has suggested switching my medication - even though I'm in remission and tolerating it well. What would you do?,"Hello! I'm 36F, diagnosed with Crohn's at 19. Since diagnosis, I have been on 150mg of Azathioprine. I have tolerated this medication very well, my bloodwork is fine, and two colonoscopies and multiple CTs and MRIs over the years have confirmed no inflammation. Aside from a few week-long bouts of otherwise unexplained diarrhea and pain here and there, I consider myself in remission from the disease. Additionally, despite having a suppressed immune system from the medication, I've never had any issues fighting off infections and only really deal with one major cold or flu per year and get through it easily.

Yesterday, I had my usual follow-up and med check with my GI. She brought up the possibility of switching my medication to a biologic such as Humira or Remicade, citing the elevated risk of lymphoma and skin cancer from the Azathioprine as a reason to make the jump. I also got the impression that as a practice, GI is moving away from Azathioprine as a regular treatment for Crohn's disease.

I accepted the medication information printouts she gave me and agreed to do the startup bloodwork necessary before starting a biologic so I could see the full picture and think about it. My husband and I read through all the papers and I am as undecided as ever. Some of the potential (though rare), serious averse reactions in the biologics sound worse than risk of lymphoma (some incurable brain disease, what??), and Googling shows that there's still an elevated risk of cancer with biologics anyway.

Another consideration is that we have one child, and might want another in the future. I took Azathioprine throughout pregnancy (at my GI's direction) and did mostly okay, until I developed cholestasis of pregnancy - which I have just found out after doing all this research is a potential risk of the medication. However, biologics seem to carry their own risks (slight increased chance of birth defects, for example).

I guess I'm in sort of a ""pick your poison"" situation, and perhaps ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

But I'm interested in your opinions, experience, etc. What would you do?

Edit: One other consideration: I'm due for a colonoscopy. If I make the switch to a biologic, they would want to do a colonoscopy 8 or 9 months afterwards to make sure the medication is doing its job. So my colonoscopy timing hinges on this too.

I was diagnosed about 1-2 months ago, and I guess I’m struggling with wrapping my head around being on stelara just to have to wrap my head around something else (with a slightly worse safety profile). 

Would like to hear others experiences (preferably positive ones if possible lol) who have been on Humira. I’m trying to just put trust in my doctors but the whole thing is scary at first.

181,Humira,weighing medication options,"hi everyone! i was recently diagnosed with Crohns ileocolitis. i’m currently on prednisone to jumpstart care. i just met with my doctors about medications and they said i have two options: Humira or Remicaid (i think that’s how it’s spelt). 

my team says that Humira is an at home injection I’d take once every 14 days, whereas Remicaid is an infusion i would get once every 2 months. 

they said that both medications have the same effectiveness, it’s just a matter of insurance and personal preference. im  still on my parents insurance so it’s really up to my preference. i am a full time college student and i work ~30 hours a week. i’m curious as to what everyone’s experiences are like on the medications. 

i’m leaning towards the humira as i don’t need to schedule my life around it as opposed to the infusions. but if there’s more pros to remicaid than humira I’d like to know! 

please let me know your experiences and your advice on these things. thanks so much yall &lt;3 ",2024-08-14 22:08:38,CrohnsDisease,5,1ese8mi,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ese8mi/weighing_medication_options/,2024-08-14
182,Humira,Keeping meds cool during travels ,"Hi there,

I’ve started taking adalimumab (think it’s also called humira) this year with good results. I’ve had a few stressful travels with it though. First trip I took it in a cool bag, kept it in a fridge, but then my plans went awry and I had to stay in a hotel. I gave them my meds to keep in the fridge, but when I got them back they were frozen. So I had to discard and order new ones whilst travelling around, which in itself was quite stressful.

I spoke to my IBD nurse about it and they assured me that I need not keep the meds in the fridge whilst travelling if it’s for under 2 weeks, so some useful learning I guess.

This time I’ve gone away again, I kept my meds in coolbox but was travelling for two days and it’s hot so ice packs thawed and coolbox was at room temperature. My nurse told me not to put meds back in the fridge once at room temp so I brought it into hotel room overnight as the car was hot. 

But now I’ve also read that they shouldn’t be kept over 25 degrees centigrade, and it’s 27-28 out at the moment. I had a gap between checking out of one place, and checking into another, and had a choice of either leaving the meds in the car, which would definitely get to over 25 degrees, putting it in the coolbox again which was now cool again, so presumably I shouldn’t put it in there either, or carrying it round with me in my bag again probably over 25degrees. 

I think a better cool bag would probably be a solution as it would allow me to keep them in the fridge during hot weather and that feels more straightforward than trying to find somewhere under 25 degrees that’s not a fridge whilst travelling around. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or solutions from their own experiences? I’m hoping to drive through France next spring and want to work out a solution before then! 

Thanks!  ",2024-08-12 12:00:12,CrohnsDisease,2,1eqbt3s,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1eqbt3s/keeping_meds_cool_during_travels/,2024-08-12
183,Humira,Need Help Holding Onto Hope,"Hello, all. I'm a young man, 22 years old to be exact, who's had IBD for 5 years, been diagnosed for 3 years. I started having symptoms when I was 17, around Fall 2019, but didn't go to finally get it checked out until December 2021. I was finally diagnosed with IBD in February 2022, (also had an MRI in May 2022 that was supposed to determine if it was UC or Crohn's but I don't remember getting a conclusive answer) and was given some time on prednisone to decide if I wanted to go on Humira or Infliximab, and started Humira around June 2022, I think. For a while, it worked great, but over time it became less effective, and I tested positive for antibodies to Humira in April 2023, and started Infliximab in June 2023. I ended up having a rash during an Infliximab infusion just 5 months later in November 2023, and was immediately switched to Entyvio.

My GI said that if Entyvio didn't work out either, I'd have to go to a specialist, but sometime between then and now, they quit, and I had to get a new GI. I've been on Entyvio for almost 9 months, and during this time, I've still been having some symptoms, even if not as bad as when unmedicated. Thus, my new GI had me get a calprotectin test and a colonoscopy last month. The calprotectin test showed a value in the thousands, while the colonoscopy showed minor active inflammation.

Because of this, they told me to get lab work for Entyvio levels and antibodies done the day before my next infusion, and to tell them if my symptoms get worse. My next infusion is this Friday, and during the last week, my symptoms have very suddenly gotten almost as bad as when I was unmedicated, which I told them about. I now have an appointment with them very early on Thursday morning to discuss other medication options. I've been thinking of asking about Rinvoq or Velsipity, but I also feel like I should mention my previous GI's intentions of sending me to a specialist if Entyvio didn't work.

On top of all this, I've been losing a lot of weight the entire time that I've been on Entyvio. From December 2021 all the way to October 2023, my weight stayed around 160 lbs, but from October 2023 to March 2024, I went to 140 lbs, and today, I'm down to 120 lbs. It's pushing me to the point of fearing for my life. I've also messaged my new GI that I want to talk about this on Thursday, with the intent of asking if they can refer me to a dietitian, especially one who has experience with IBD patients.

I don't know what the future holds for me at this point. I've been reading here the past few days, and seen that medications don't work forever, but I've also seen that they should last for around 10 years. I've burned through 3 medications already, none of which have even lasted a single year. Has anyone else here been through similar circumstances and ended up finding a medication that worked for a longer period of time? I'm afraid that if I end up having to have surgery, I'll be stuck with a bag for the rest of my life, because in my case the inflammation goes the whole way from the rectum to the end of the colon, so it would have to be a total proctocolectomy, and because I don't know if it's UC or Crohn's, I don't know if I can get a J-pouch. My life is a mess in general right now as well, so I'm having a hard time seeing a light at the end of *any* of the tunnels I'm currently in. Does anyone here have any advice or even just words of encouragement that might help me deal with at least this one?",2024-08-11 20:58:49,CrohnsDisease,4,1epvb3o,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1epvb3o/need_help_holding_onto_hope/,2024-08-11

187,Humira,Humira Side Effects?,"Hello everyone,

I just wanted to get some opinions on this. I just took my first dose of Humira (160mg) last Monday and ever since then I've been having all sorts of weird symptoms going on.

Hours after I took the dose I started having blood in my stool, which was strange because my Crohn's doesn't do that unless I have a flare up. This lasted until last Thursday and my stool turned back to normal.

Then on Saturday I started having some minor chest pain, along with some shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Since then it hasn't gone away. It occurs pretty infrequently, I feel fine for some hours then it feels like a just ran a mile even though I'm either sitting or standing still. 

Yesterday I then woke up with some sharp abdominal pains on the right side of my body along with some gurgling noises. Since I started the Humira my typically Crohn's symptoms have greatly reduced, and I didn't eat or drink anything that wasn't outside of my typical safety foods. It flares up every now and then for a minute before going away.

Later that same day I went to the bathroom and my stool was a pale-ish grey color.

Today I now woke up with a cough, and while not severe I'm afraid it might turn into something worse. 

I checked up with a GI doctor and they ruled out anything severe like an infection, liver failure, or a blockage. I'm also getting an X-ray done tomorrow to check if anything is wrong. For now though I'm stuck wondering what this could all be, and I'm worried something bad might happen in the next few days.

192,Humira,31 year old with Crohns disease living in Florida on a quest to get my life back ,"Really, this is a question for people with Crohns disease that have recent or current histories/struggles with pain management doctors in Florida. I am hearing all kinds of conflicting and conflating information, yet, I know that Crohns disease is considered a Chronic pain condition and indeed I would agree. Some seem to think getting pain medicine ought to be a breeze for me, even now - others not so much given the state of Floridas medical/pain management industry. 

I was diagnosed by seventeen, I had a bowel resection by the time I was 22 which took nearly two feet of my intestines; I've had several other surgeries/complications (mostly gross so I won't mention them,) but suffice it to say I have extensive medical records and many times have I had colonoscopies/endoscopies' I've had my share of Fistulotomies and Blockages and I even had my appendix removed. 

In addition to this, I have a blown out disk in my back from a car accident which occurred 7-8 years ago. I also broke my wrist as a kid, and have developed Arthritis and Carpel tunnel in my arms from being a Bartender for a decade. 

My gastro and I had a conversation when I was 17 about avoiding pain medication for as long as possible when I was diagnosed - basically acknowledging that given the fact that I was having such severe issues at 17, it was an inevitability that we'd arrive at this point eventually and indeed at 31 I believe I am about there. 

For many years I used Cannabis and more recently, Kratom to effectively manage my pain symptoms. In fact, Kratom DOES work - however I believe that putting a quarter ounce of kratom powder down my liver every week is going to lead to much worse consequences in the long run and I'm beginning to get sick and experience a lot of liver pain from the Kratom after 6-7 years of use. 

So it seem so to me I've reached this point where I need to accept that I am going to have to proceed into pain management if I am going to continue being able to lead a quality of life good enough to support me as I attempt to buy a house and settle down with a family hopefully soon. 

I do not know where to begin. After my bowel resection, I have been self managing my illness myself so to as avoid the industry poison that these scam artists push - like Humira for instance. I am not taking a F\*\*\*ing immunosuppressant and becoming a recluse that can't leave his house all because other people are worried about me potentially developing an addiction. I could give two shits less about any of this. I don't want asprins, its more poison for somebody with crohns and they don't help anything.  
  
Oxycodone and Dilaudid were often given to me during my surgeries/multi-week stints in the hospital in my earlier twenties because it was obvious that my complications were leading to enormous pain. I even had a Dilaudid IV drip/button when I got my resection - I had one of those timed button drip release for weeks.

I will say that Dilaudid and Oxycodone worked very very well for managing my symptoms over all and in general, pain. It worked surprisingly well in regulating my bowel movements and for some strange reason, with oxycodone I do not need to use the bathroom 15 times a day. 

So Kratom is destroying my liver, Cannabis isn't quite enough to do the trick anymore on its own, and I am personally comfortable with taking all risks associated with opiate addiction, I really don't care what other people think I know I'll be fine. I am a highly creative and industrious person, and my illness is coming in between my ability to succeed in my business, my art, my music and my family; my entire qualia of life in general. I am comfortable being a opiate addict with a prescription for the rest of my life if it means I can continue to pursue my career goals, life goals, and continue to spend time with my family like I used to be able to. 

So if you're still reading, I appreciate your patience and you taking the time to hear me out because I""m trying to paint a picture here as the medical industry is just fucked up in Florida from my understanding.

I have a chronic pain condition with extensive surgical history and several other issues which OUGHT to qualify me, at this stage, for some type of pain management therapy. Although I have a lot of people convinced that they won't give me anything. In my experience though, most Doctors take crohns very seriously. Florida law however could give a \*\*\*\* less about any of this though. And, ofcourse, there are doctors out there that will understand; even if they might cost me. 

So where do I begin? I have no insurance btw. If I need to pay out of pocket, I will for pain management I am fine with that. And I don't need warnings or redditor opinions on why I should avoid opiate addiction - If this sounds like you then I'd prefer not to waste both of our time listening to your opinion.  
  
 I do have genuine chronic pain issues and I've had a bowel resection. I was barely an adult when I had it. Shoveling pounds of kratom powder down my liver is making me ill at this point and why do that when I can just take a pill with a few milligrams of powder instead and achieve the same effect. Its time I just accept it for what it is and do my best to live my most productive and meaningful life - thats what this is about.  

So I need to see a pain Doctor. I have no insurance at the moment, but I'll pay out of pocket if I have to. I have a Gastro I've worked who diagnosed me that will usually see me for free because he knows I don't have insurance. I do not need a referral though because I do not have insurance, correct?  
  
 Give it to me straight reddit, some of you will say conflicting things but the truth will lay somewhere near the middle of it all. What do I do next, where do I go from here?

203,Humira,Opinions on what I should do ,"I (25m) have been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease since 2020. I’ve taken Humira and have most recently been on Stelara for about two years. My inflammation markers went up slightly, and my gastroenterologist recommended an increase in the Stelara dosage, claiming that most people with Crohn’s are leaning towards surgical options. 

Long story short, my insurance didn’t want to pay for the increased dosage, and my doctor’s office is now suggesting that I meet with a surgeon, despite my repeated statements that I feel fine. The only symptoms I experience are occasional bloating and a little bit of cramping, but nothing significant and certainly less severe than it was years ago. 

What’s your opinion on this? Should I go see the surgeon to hear what they have to say, or should I fight my insurance to get my medication covered? My quality of life is not bad, and I don’t feel like I need surgery.",2024-06-06 12:01:59,CrohnsDisease,3,1d9ghtg,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d9ghtg/opinions_on_what_i_should_do/,2024-06-06
204,Humira,Thoughts on Aza? ,"I’ve been on azathioprine for years. I’ve stayed in remission on it and I’m on the lowest possible dose. I experience no side effects on it. Recently though I switched to humira mostly because my doctor was like “there are better treatments available to you today that are more targeted” as I had been on the aza since I was diagnosed in 2016. 


I’ve noticed on humira, I have more energy and no body aches or pains or stiff muscles or back aches. Does this mean I might have undiagnosed arthritis and the humira helps that as well?? 


Humira is kind of wrecking my skin though (I have rosacea) which is a deal breaker for me(I have enough to deal with and having decent skin is important to me.) is it bad to just stay on azathioprine long term? It has worked for me. But now that my body soreness/aches (which I just thought was me getting older or having a terrible bed…I’m only 34 though.)  

I guess I’m just wondering if there is anyone that has been on azathioprine long term and it was ok. And if humira eases my muscles, do I have some other stuff going on? ",2024-05-31 04:23:57,CrohnsDisease,3,1d4n4jd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d4n4jd/thoughts_on_aza/,2024-05-31

208,Humira,Entyvio experiences please!,"So, I’m deciding between Entyvio and Remicade.
The only reason I’m having a hard time deciding is because I developed antibodies to Humira, and I tend to get really achey in my spine when I flare. Doc said the Entyvio might not help with that and the Remicade would. However, did anyone experience a relief in other symptoms with Entyvio, based on the fact that it got your GI under control? Or was your experience similar to what the doctor was saying?

I’m just worried I’ll go on Remicade for nothing and my body will reject it due to antibodies. I would love to hear others experiences.",2024-04-30 22:01:06,CrohnsDisease,4,1ch56ur,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ch56ur/entyvio_experiences_please/,2024-04-30
209,Humira,Biologics and Reactions / Information - I'm new ,"Hey all, 
I'm relatively new to this whole Crohn's thing. I have severe constipation with mine. I recently started Biologics, specifically Humira and would like to hear from some of you about your experiences and what to expect. 
Firstly, I've been having injection  site reactions the past couple injections - the injection site welts and gets red and itchy in the nearby area. This usually is the case for 3-5 days following the injection. How common is this? At what point do I say something to my doctor? 
Secondly, my doctor casually mentioned that I would likely be on it likely the rest of my life or until my body starts to develop antibodies. Were any of you able to achieve remission and able to maintain it without biologics or is it really a lifer med? 
Thirdly, my doctor said it would be safe for pregnancy. I'm not currently pregnant but would like kids in the next five years. Have any of you been pregnant while on biologics? Any complications or things you noticed? Any information on IBD with pregnancy would be lovely really. 
Lastly, how do any of you manage the fatigue and joint pain? I think that fatigue is Crohn's related and the joint pain didn't start until after I started the gummies
Humira. My doctor did warn me that it might cause arthritic pain though.

213,Humira,"Finally, Humira Approved! ","After a very long frustrating (and depressing) battle for remicade, that ultimately ended in denial; followed by what seemed would be another frustrating and  repeat battle for humira… the humira has finally been approved, and loading doses will ship on Monday, to be delivered on Tuesday. With the help of the Abbvie complete card, copay on it will only be $5. (Phew!)

Ironically, got the good news from the specially pharmacy, while I was on my way to the ER.  I was having bad dizzy spells, blood in stool, and pain in my side was at a peak. None of which of course were new symptoms for me, just reached a point where I was absolutely miserable and hadn’t really slept in days due to the pain. Was anemic, but not low enough to warrant a transfusion this time; inflammation markers were very high; and CT showed inflammation through colon and terminal illeum; again, none of which was new news. No apparent obstruction, which was kind of a worry though. Ultimately just loaded me up with IV steroids and pain meds, and sent me home with a tapered prescription for prednisone. 

As much as I despise the side effects I experience from steroids, it’s much needed to help get some inflammation down while waiting for the humira to arrive, and for it to (fingers crossed), start doing its thing. Does feel very good to finally have something that can maybe finally help though. Feels a little like Christmas in April, lol.

214,Humira,Totally desperate and at the end of my rope- Anyone with gastroduodenal crohn's????,"I will try to keep this brief.  Diagnosed with Crohn's of the terminal ileum in 2005.  Managed to reach endoscopic remission in 2010 using steroids after almost dying from serum sickness after 1 dose of Remicade.  Did not medicate other than for small flares until 2017 when I began experiencing nocturnal diarrhea, pain, nausea and vomiting.  Had Crohn's throughout colon, and stricturing of the terminal ileum.  Tried Humira, got Lupus.  Had first resection (30 cm) in 2018 with many complications including C-Diff.  Was put on Entyvio.  Began to experience severe pain and nausea after eating, which often resulted in vomiting and 20-30 liquid BM's a day.  GI did scopes and blood work and said things were ""not great, but good enough"". Was hospitalized due to malnutrition and fed by TPN for 6 weeks in 2019.  Scope could not pass through into small bowel.  Scans were ok- sometimes showing bowel wall thickening, sometimes collapsed bowel, sometimes partial blockage.  Nausea increased to point I only ate tiny meals several times a day.  Only relief came on steroids.  Was hospitalized in 2020 for adrenal insufficiency and malnutrition for 3 weeks.  Put on low dose of hydrocortisone to taper.  In 2021 I was in ER bi weekly for nausea and rehydration.  Dr prescribed IM Gravol injections to keep me out of the hospital due to Covid and safety.  Did those twice a day for a year, even to keep down fluids.  Had a severe flare up of 50 plus BM's a day after being told my scope was fine in 2022.  Hospitalized for 7 weeks, stricture found again in ileum.  20 cm resected.  Was supposed to begin Stelara immediately, but GI delayed and did not start until 6 months later.  Pain and nausea and diarrhea increased to the point that by August of 2023 I went on a completely liquid diet.  CT's showed active Crohn's, blood work showed chronic anemia, but because CRP was normal, and scope showed only mild disease, GI refused steroids or a change of medicine.  I could not function.  I lost 15 lbs.  I kept having to go to ER for rehydration and IV meds because I could not keep anything down.  They wanted to admit me each time, but due to hospital overcrowding, never had a bed.  I could not stay in a chair in the ER for days. 

On Feb 12th I began to run a high fever and filled the toilet with black stool twice.  I was projectile vomiting.  Went to ER, was admitted.  Spent 8 weeks there.  Fired GI and hired IBD specialist in another city.  My blood work was atroctious- kidney issues, liver issues, anemia, CRP hit 50 on a day when my fever spiked to 104.  ALL SCANS NORMAL INCLUDING BARIUM FOLLOW THROUGH.  My left side of my lower abdomen had become so swollen and distended I could not wear pants.  Also, hot to the touch.  Sometimes 50 plus bms a day even on complete bowel rest and TPN.  Upper endoscopy histapathology showed inflammation in Esophagus, duodenum and chronic gastritis with focal mural wall involvement.  CT showed duodenal diverticulum. No H pylori, no celiac disease.  My lower colon is all normal on histapathology.   Also was discovered I was in adrenal near failure with a cortisol level of 11 and a tumour on my pituitary.  Was put on a rescue dose of 150 mg of hydrocortisone for 3 days, then brought down to 20 mg twice a day.  Diarrhea and vomiting continued unless given IV Gravol and pain meds every 4 hours.  SPENT 8 WEEKS IN HOSPITAL.  Then, my new GI went on vacay and I was only under the care of the hospitalist who changed weekly.  My GP left practice and I suddenly had no medical care.  They wanted me out of the hospital so took me off TPN even though I could not keep food or meds down.  I was also found to have complete stenosis and was given. a surgical port which I am not allowed to access on my own, and no home care.  I was released from hospital on Friday with a severely swollen tummy (left side only) I have not been able to keep food or fluids down, even giving IM and sub q meds up to 12 times a day for pain and nausea.  I am still on a liquid diet.  Can't even stand the smell of food.

I have no idea what to do.  I don't know when my GI will be back or when I can speak with her.  I am so sick and exhausted I can barely speak.  I can't even make myself a cup of tea.  There are no doctors taking new patients in my area and I will run out of meds in 2 weeks.  I know I probably have to go back to the ER but I am traumatized and scared as there is no GI department.  I would need to travel 3 hours to nearest hospital with GI and I am so sick I can hardly dress myself.

I am fairly certain I have developed gastroduodenal Crohn's.  Does anyone on here have it and can you relate to my journey?  I've been reading NIH and Mayo clinic papers and this seems to be the only thing that fits.  Also, my multiple BMs are dark green and completely liquid.  I am also incontinent.

215,Humira,Starting humira after being on remicade for 3 years,"I asked my GI doctor if i would be able to get my remicade infusion every 8 weeks again instead of 6 now that iv’e been in remission again for a while. He suggested starting with the s.c. injection instead since getting humira every 2 weeks or remicade every 8 weeks for people who are in remission had the same outcome. So in 4 weeks I will get my first s.c. injection. 

I’m very excited to start humira, because this means that I don’t have to plan my travels/life around my infusion. At the same time, i’m quite scared to start something new after being on remicade for 3 years. 

Anyone els who uses humira or an other type of s.c. medication or who has switched from iv to sc medication? What is your experience with it? Do you find it easier or more difficult to travel? Because now I do have to bring medication with me when travelling when before I didn’t. But with my IV infusion I couldn’t just travel whenever I wanted to or even plan a simple day trip because i had to be near the hospital to get my infusion.

I still feel okay, mainly just constipated and get nauseous if I eat too much, but I thought it was working. Apparently my humira levels are lower than they should be and my body has created antibodies against it.

My doctor gave me three options: take humira every week instead of every other, keep taking humira every other week but add either azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to combat the antibodies, or to switch to a new biologic (they recommended skyrizi).

I’m just wondering if any of you have any experience with any of these medications and if they worked for you. I don’t think I’m going to do the first option.

222,Humira,Skyrizi Update,"Hi everyone! When I was first prescribed Skyrizi I scoured this sub high and low for experience so I thought I’d add mine in as I have just achieved clinical remission on it. 

Back story: I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2012 with the world’s nastiest fistula and abscess, as well an ileum so diseased I ended up having over 20 surgeries and several months long hospital stays. I was on Remicade and then Humira and then was able to quit medication in 2018. 

I’m a 28 year old woman, I also lost my gallbladder and have PCOS. If that helps anyone else lol 

Last summer I was marathon training when I gave myself runner’s colitis which hospitalized me and sent me into a flare. This was August. Fecal call was 3600ug. Interestingly enough, no ileum recurrence, just in my colon which I’d never had before. 

August - October: Prednisone taper. 

September: first IV dose of Skyrizi. Had a headache after but then I was fine. 

October: second IV dose of Skyrizi, first fecal cal update: 190ug. Enough for my GI to request a scope. Scope showed inflammation was down but was prescribed mesalomine for a month. 

November: last loading IV dose. Still pooping a LOT. Started using a symptom tracking app and discovered it’s because of the gallbladder bile not being able to bind to anything as I wasn’t eating enough fat. Began incorporating fat. 

December: Clinic showed me how to do the self injection. 

January: first self Skyrizi injection. Went great! Way less painful than Humira. 

February: felt less fatigued enough to start working out again! 

This week (March): fecal cal came back as 33!!!!

So far the only odd symptom I’ve had with Skyrizi is that I’m far more prone to ingrown hairs, which is apparently a thing? So I make sure to exfoliate well when I wax and shave. I still cannot tolerate raw fruits, veg, or seeds but lost a lot of small intestine so that makes sense. Rare bouts of diarrhea when I eat ice cream for dinner, shocked. Lifts are not back to where they were, like 40 pounds off on the big 3, but getting there.

223,Humira,"Back in hospital, treatment just started working","It's a beautiful feeling, and I forgot how bad I'm damaged by my experience during diagnosis.

I've avoided hospital since 2018. I got switched on to humira and the stuff is pretty damn good.

Buuut, for the last week I've been flaring. I know I've been flaring, diarrhoea like a mofo and unbearable abdominal pain... today I finally hit the ""it's not getting better on its own"" point and reported to the doctors who sent me to A&amp;E.

Until a few hours ago I still had the old nonsense in my head; what if it's not crohn's this time? what if there is something different going on? maybe I'm wrong?

Diagnosis was rough, 3 years of medical professionals telling me I'm medically fine. I always worry going in that I'm going to be sent away without treatment and hearing that I must be fine. That was 2012 and I still feel that sometimes.

Anyway, administered corticosteroids and IV Fluids a few hours ago. Bloods normal, so nothing else up with any other silly internal organs. And, I just got up to pee and the pain in my abdomen has come right down. When I got here, moving made me scream. I can now walk to the loo and back fine.

I'm super happy that a) the pain is settling it's been bad for 3 days, and b) it is just crohn's.

Question for doctors; patient presents clutching their abdomen and a diagnosis of Crohn's... what's wrong with them?

According to my GP it could be my pancreas or gall bladder. fml.

225,Humira,Currently experiencing one of the worst flare ups I've ever had,"This is my first post on this subreddit, and I don't use reddit very often, so bear with me.
I was diagnosed with Crohn's back in 2018 when I was 18, and I've used Humira and Stelara since then. I don't think I've ever fully been in remission, as my doctor is never completely satisfied with my lab and image results. I once again am about to switch to a new medication, this time it's Skyrizi (fingers crossed it works better for me than Humira or Stelara did). 
However, for whatever reason, my pain and symptoms have been so much worse since some time in January this year. I've been getting debilitating abdominal pain after pretty much every time I eat something (more common in the evenings and nights for some reason). When this pain comes on, it feels like all I can do is roll around on my bed while moaning and groaning, it fucking sucks lol. I obviously reached out to my doctor about this and he decided to put me on an 8 week prednisone course to try to reduce some inflammation. The prednisone worked right away for me, and I felt like how I did before this flare up started, which was just mild pain every now and then and going to the bathroom a little more often than other people.
Now, with only 2 weeks left of this prednisone course, the very severe symptoms are back, and I have no idea why. I've been getting stomach pain that is probably at a 7 or 8 on the pain scale, which immediately makes my mouth begin to water and sometimes I throw up. Could this be happening because I'm taking much less prednisone per day than when I started? I know that there are countless variables that affect this disease so I'm not even sure if there is an answer that can help me. I have another doctors appointment in 2 weeks before I switch to Skyrizi, but I'm writing this because it's 4am and I can't sleep due to the pain I'm in. Does anyone have any advice for me on how to help manage this pain? Has anyone had a similar experience to mine? I appreciate any and all insight.",2024-03-11 10:35:50,CrohnsDisease,11,1bc05b0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1bc05b0/currently_experiencing_one_of_the_worst_flare_ups/,2024-03-11
226,Humira,My new BioAdvance (Janssen) rep is only adding to my CD stress instead of helping me. Is this now the intended behaviour from them or is it just who I ended up with? Could my doctor (or someone else) get me a new rep if I asked?,"I'm not scheduled to see my doctor again until the summer, so in the meantime I figured I'd ask here if anyone's had a similar experience and how they handled it.

I've been on Stelara for nearly four years now (while waiting for Health Canada to approve Remsima for Crohn's, ayy lmao) and didn't deal with the rep(s) from their BioAdvance program beyond the original infusion setup. That didn't start off well, because I had to get my doctor's office to nudge them to actually talk to me because the rep I originally got never answered the phone when I called. Even when I needed a re-infusion, I just talked to staff at the infusion clinic, not even with whoever I would've had as my rep at that point. That, combined with similar experiences from four years on Humira (where I basically found out I had a new rep every time I talked to them) means I typically just don't really talk to my reps unless I really have to, which is thankfully rare. For three years I didn't hear a peep from them, and never needed to reach out to them for anything either - but now, into my fourth year, I apparently got a new rep, and she's... well-meaning, I'm sure, but... she's basically the opposite of my previous reps, but unfortunately not in a good way.

She's been calling me at least once a month, though often more because she doesn't call me within the timeframe I've asked her to - I've explained to her that I work nights and sleep during the day, but yet she insists on calling me at 10 AM every time anyway (which is smack in the middle of my sleeping hours)... and then doesn't answer when I call back in the afternoon. I've suggested having her just email me but she won't do that either, and I can't flip my sleeping hours around just in case she decides to call me. She keeps calling purely to ""check in"" and ask me if my insurance has changed (it hasn't, they just won't cover my Stelara so that's why I'm on their compassionate care thing). I keep telling her I'll reach out if there's changes or if I need to talk to her about something, but she still insists on having to talk to me anyway even when I'm not asking to talk to her. The worst incident happened over the holidays, where she effectively threatened to cut off my compassionate care if I didn't call her back fast enough - I had to, quite sternly, explain that I barely even had time for myself at that time of year to begin with because it's the busiest time at my workplace (basically just work and sleep for the better part of 3 months or so), and that it would be a lot easier to talk to her if she didn't constantly call while I was sleeping and answered the phone in the afternoon when I wake up. Losing access to my meds is one of my worst fears, so you can guess this didn't exactly go down well for me from a mental health point of view.

Is this constant contact now the expected behaviour from reps, or did I just get someone who's really pushy and keeps asking to talk to me when she doesn't need to? Would I be able to change reps if I bring this up with my doctor or someone else in the program, or is this one of those things where a specific area is all covered by one person and I'm effectively stuck with her? This illness is already stressful enough as it is, and unfortunately, she's only adding to that stress right now.

227,Humira,can i take accutane with crohn’s disease?,"i’m 20f and i’ve had this diagnoses for almost a year now. i’ve been on humira also for almost a year. i’ve been dealing with acne all my life and it’s still following me into adulthood. i go to a dermatologist and she says they usually treat acne in people my age with antibiotics. but she didn’t put me on those because long term antibiotics will mess up my resident flora and other things or whatever. i am currently taking spironolactone 75mg and use tretinoin cream and have been using this regimen for about 5 months now. she upped my dosage of spironolactone last appt and said if we don’t see a change in the next six weeks we should consider accutane. i’ve heard that it does work wonders for acne but causes a plethora of side effects including long term ones. i was wondering if anyone has experience of being on accutane and having crohns and what it was like. is it a good idea? should i propose a different course of treatment? my appointment is tomorrow and my acne is pretty bad right now, so no change since last appointment. just looking to hear if anyone has any experience with it. thanks in advance!

228,Humira,What do flares feel like for you?,"Hi! I am aware that this disease affects us all very differently, but I’m really trying to figure out if what I’ve experienced is a flare or not. Here’s some background. 

I was diagnosed this past fall and put on a prednisone taper and Humira. Pretty much immediately went into remission and never felt better. Or so I thought. A few weeks ago, out of the blue, I woke up in the middle of the night with intense stomach pains. A very different type of pain than what I’m used to with my symptoms. Normally I have a crampy pain after eating, but this wasn’t food induced and felt like stabbing pain. Then came the nausea. I threw up around 10 times and couldn’t keep water down but I was extremely thirsty. I felt kinda backed up but couldn’t produce a bowel movement and was only barely able to pass gas. I was afraid it could be an obstruction, so I went to the ER. They did a CT and it looked the same as it did months ago with chronic inflammation, so they ruled it a flare. But my CRP was only very very slightly elevated (normal range 0-0.5, mine was 0.61, at diagnosis it was 5.72). They gave me fluids and tylenol, which did help me feel better, and sent me on my way. Had a follow up with my GI later that week and started on a new prednisone taper, added azathioprine, and increased the Humira frequency. Now, a few weeks later, it happened again last night. Same exact symptoms. It’s absolutely miserable. It took me over 6 hours until I was finally able to go to sleep. Now it makes me suspicious that this isn’t just a flare considering I’m currently on prednisone and azathioprine and Humira. 

Has anyone experience anything like this before? Is it normal for a flare to be so sporadic like that? I always thought of it as something that persisted over weeks-months, not popping up for a day at a time.

229,Humira,Question about flair’s and meds…,"So, I was diagnosed about 16 months ago, 51m. I was on Prednisone for about 10 months, then moved to Humira about four months ago. Things have been definitely staying greatly improved, plaque psoriasis has cleared up and left town, the arthritis symptoms in the joints was lessened and sometimes goes away altogether but it is apparent now. I’m just starting to see signs of light internal bleeding for the first time since being on steroids or Humera. Problem is my GI had some sort of emergency and they said he is unavailable for a bit and pushed my appointment out two months. I am currently looking out of town for a new doc. In the meantime, can flares still happen on a med like Humira, would steroids be used in conjunction with, do you still experience a flare and consider the Humira to be “working” effectively and stay that course?

230,Humira,Crohn’s Or IBS Symptoms?,"According to my last blood tests in December, I’m still in full remission. I’ve been on Humira for over a year now and I was declared officially in remission in August. 

I’ve had IBS symptoms my whole life. If I’m stressed, I have diarrhea. If I eat something too fast or eat the wrong thing, diarrhea and cramping and gas. It can be extremely painful. 

My Crohn’s symptoms are the same level of pain, with extras. Lots of gas, lots of diarrhea, usually blood in the toilet, mouth ulcers, fatigue, and extreme bloating. 

I’ve never been diagnosed with IBS but it tends to run in my family. 

Tuesday night was my birthday, so I had a few glasses of wine. I also ate some cake pops and small pieces of pizza, which I’m sure could’ve irritated me since I don’t eat junk often or barely drink. 

Yesterday I didn’t have many bathroom issues but to be on the safe side I ate mostly soft foods and things I tolerate easily. I did have some ice cream, though. That can bother me sometimes. I had a little pain in my abdomen but more like “bowel upset” pain than straight up “I know I’m in a Crohn’s flare” pain. 

Tonight I ate some Mexican food and immediately after finishing dinner I had to go to the bathroom. It was a painful sense of urgency, but the pain was mostly relieved after the movement. The stool was formed, too. I felt like I had to go more but it seemed like I was slightly constipated.  Earlier in the day I had no issues with breakfast or lunch. 

My grandma took me out for dessert, and before eating I still had a little pain like I had to use the bathroom, but it wasn’t a big deal. Then immediately after eating dessert I had to go to the bathroom, and I had diarrhea. I saw some bits of undigested food, but I eat dried lentils as a snack and I thought those don’t digest easily for a lot of people, anyway. I felt sick through the movement but it passed and after going I felt better. 

I’ve had a snack and went out since and I don’t have any pain or bloating, but I have some noisy gas in my stomach. 

I’m worried I’m no longer in remission but don’t want to run into the doctor if it’s just “I ate the wrong thing”, especially when I have some tests coming up in not super long. I’m absolutely terrified of needing Prednisone again because it was a horrific experience. 

Does this sound more like I just ate a little too much junk and some diarrhea caught up with me after initially being constipated? Or could that be wishful thinking? Lol 

Anyone with both Crohn’s and a IBS able to give me pointers on how to tell which is which?",2024-02-16 04:39:53,CrohnsDisease,2,1as016s,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1as016s/crohns_or_ibs_symptoms/,2024-02-16
231,Humira,Entyvio: failure or more time?,"Hello fellow Chronies 👋 I am back again to ask others advice or experience with Entyvio. For reference my first loading dose was Aug 15th 2023, so it's been about 6 months. I'd say it took at least 2-3 months after starting to see any improvement of my symptoms. Once I got past the loading dose and on my 2nd 8 week infusion my levels were tested and looked good.  
  
At that point I was starting to see an improvement. I'd say my symptoms went from unbearable to manageable (went from diariah to sludge, extreme cramping to slight cramping, and no blood or stool in my stool). Minus a weird complete relief for a week while cruising (lol). So I was thinking I would continue the treatment with hopes I would continue to get better but I don't feel I ever achieved fill remission like I did for 2.5 years on Renflexis.  
  
I switched insurance on the new year so I was about 2-3 weeks late on my recent infusion which I got on Jan 24th. I have been on a serious decline pretty much since then. I'm back to diariah, completely unprocessed food in my stool, extreme cramping every meal and bowel movement, fatigue,  pretty bad bloating (like 2 sizes bigger in my pants. Thank God for maternity pants!), and now I'm seeing a little blood and mucus in my stools.  
  
I'm not due to see my GI till March but I was able to get in for a flare appointment this Friday. But dang, I'm not sure if being late for my infusion is affecting this or if it's time to throw in the towel on this treatment route. They told me if I fail Entyvio my next option is Humira but I'm not thrilled about self injecting and I've heard mixed things about it.  
  
Has anyone else on Entyvio experienced this after being late on a dose, or is it normal to take 6+ months to achieve full remission on Entyvio?

233,Humira,Obstructions &amp; Biologics,"I had another obstruction last week. They are becoming much more frequent, and I'm waiting for SkyRizi. I've tried just about every other biologic, and none seem able to keep me in remission. It's infuriating that when the doc said it'd be 4-6 weeks to handle the insurance stuff, and I call for an update after 6 weeks &amp; nothing had even been started. It's bad enough I'm likely to have to appeal it after they deny it. Anyone here get any relief from SkyRizi who didn't see any results with Entyvio, Remicade, Humira (worked a little for a while), Inflectra (that one nearly killed me), Stelara..or some similar scenario?

I used to go to the hospital when it happened, but now if I don't need an NG tube, I don't even bother anymore since they don't treat pain at all, I have to wait in the ER for 12 hours because they don't let my gastro pre-admit me anymore, and the treatment is the same at home, minus the IV - Prednisone, NPO, maybe some Miralax. Do you get the same nonsense at the ER, where they offer you Tylenol &amp; call you drug-seeker if you ask for pain meds? I wish these snot-nosed ER docs could experience a bowel obstruction for 10 minutes.

234,Humira,Switching to Rinvoq after failing Stelara and Humira,"I was diagnosed in Sep. 2020 with moderate to severe CD.  After a round of prednisone, I started on mesalamine but after a couple of weeks it made me really sick.  Then moved to Humira, which worked great for about 1 year until I flared up again.  Calprotectin was &gt;658.  Another round of prednisone.  Doc then switched me to Stelara (one infusion + maintenance shots), which worked great for about 1 year.  I also changed my diet during my time on Stelara: no gluten (this helped tremendously), and limited dairy, alcohol, and spicy foods.  

After a recent colonoscopy showing active inflammation, my doc had me take another infusion dose hoping to knock it out.  Post-infusion I was feeling OK and that lasted about 2-3 months.  

Over the last month, however, I’ve been having a lot of diarrhea and I’m not feeling like myself (forgetfulness, dizziness, and overall exhaustion).  My bloodwork is OK but my calprotectin came back at &gt;658 again.  My doc recommended Budesonide in the meantime (which has already helped me feel more energetic and “with it”) and a switch to Rinvoq. 

I’m nervous about switching medications again, but hopeful that Rinvoq will work for me in the long term.  Has anyone had a similar experience, and found relief with Rinvoq?

And despite being prepared for that I was not prepared for what treatment would be like for me. 

My specialist says I’m at the point where infusions will be the best route for me and she is recommending starting either Stelara or Remicade. I know I won’t be able to give myself injections and I’m not sure I fully trust anyone else to do it for me outside of a medical facility. What are your guys experience with infusions like? Any side effect with either of those drugs? Do you think it’s easier to give yourself injections instead of going in every 8 weeks for infusions? I know everyone’s had different experiences. This treatment plan just threw me off and I’m looking for a little guidance and suggestions on how everyone deals with this while I’m trying to decide which route would be best for me to take. It feels a little scary knowing this is something that I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life. Any advice would be much appreciated!

368,Stelara,has anyone switched from remicade to another biologic and lost weight?,"Disclaimer: I am going to speak to my Doctor, I am even going to get a second opinion as I might be changing doctors and possibly medications due to a number of issues. I am just looking to see if anyone has a firsthand anecdotal experience with this.

 My question is: has anyone who gained significant weight on an anti-tnf blocker like remicade then switched to another non-anti TNF biologic like stelara or entiyvo etc. and noticed that they lost that weight? I have read so many posts from others who gained 20-30 lbs or more from remicade and no amount of diet or exercise changed it. This has been my experience too. I have seen articles online talking about specifically anti-TNF biologics causing more weight gain over other biologics but I see posts about all biologics causing weight gain too. I am trying to see if there is anyone who has made that switch in biologics and experienced a positive weight loss. 

Additional Background: I am one of the people that gains weight on remicade. Increased belly fat, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat (I'm also a very short person so it shows). I know and multiple doctors (PCP, Gastro, Endo, Gyno, dietician) have all ruled out other causes and confirmed that my weight issues are from Remicade. I can track the weight gain from when I started remicade and each time I had to increase the time between doses (every 3 ½ month to 8 weeks, now every 4 weeks) I have gained about 10-12 pounds for a total of 35lbs. This was not just “your body is now absorbing things weight” this was excessive weight when I wasn’t even underweight or had lost any weight to begin with. It’s caused by the remicade and its driving me nuts and causing its own issues after 20 years of this.

369,Stelara,Looking for Rinvoq Encouragement,"I’ve had a wonderful run on infliximab but our time together has unfortunately come to an end. I’m 24F and been on it cumulatively for about 9/10 years. There was a period of time I came off of it to try entivyo and stelara which I failed both and actually developed my perianal fistula on. My first GI took me off it initially cuz even tho I had no symptoms, my CRP wasn’t ideal. Pretty dumb in retrospect.

After having EUA and a seton placed in 2018, I immediately went back on Remicade with methotrexate for a period of time to mitigate antibodies. I’ve been able to stay on it since then with my crohns being pretty ok, but never having perfect bloodwork or legit remission since. Symptoms were there but manageable and my fistula under control which was good enough for me. 

Within the past year, I’ve had a harder time tolerating the infusions and they have become very intrusive on my life. I get it every 4 weeks so every month I’d have to take 2-3 days to tolerate the infusions. Because of this, my GI tested for the Histone antibody which came back positive which apparently signals drug induced lupus. Now I have no choice but to come off Remicade and try rinvoq. 

I’m essentially terrified of coming off Remicade and developing perianal problems again. I know rinvoq has helped a lot of people, but there’s no guarantee for each individual.

I was having upper gastric ulcer-like symptoms as well as horrific joint and muscle pain all over my body. I could barely walk for almost a year. When my dr recommended the upper endoscopy, I suggested we do a colonoscopy as well, even though I’m only 25 and already had a colonoscopy just 4 years ago for a c. diff FMT and knew all looked well back then. I was a walking medical mystery for so long so I decided we might as well do both and get it out of the way. Anyway, it was incredibly shocking to see than my intestines are WRECKED. I have no lower abdominal pain or diarrhea at all. I’ve always struggled with constipation but even that is usually mostly under control. And yet, severe Crohn’s colitis/lots of damage!

375,Stelara,Pregnancy: Worth the risk? Would love to hear your stories! ,"I realize that this is a personal decision... but I would love to hear input from others in this community who have given birth. 



\*\*If you've given birth:\*\* 

- What was your disease status during pregnancy? (level of activity / meds)?

- Did you have a history of surgery? 

	- If yes, what type of surgery? Was is laparoscopic or open? Did you have adhesions?

- Did your disease/surgery history make birth challenging? 

- Did you have fears for your own safety through the pregnancy / birth process (related to IBD)?

- Any advice for making an informed decision?



\*\*About me:\*\*

I have aggressive Crohn's, but I've been in remission for the last \~5 years on a combo of Stelara + 6MP. I've had four major surgeries, two of them have been open. I have had issues with fibrosis and adhesions from past surgeries (although I am not experiencing any currently). I now have an ostomy (with rectum removed). 

My husband and I want children. We are considering adoption, but having our own seems simpler than jumping through adoption hoops. Our biggest fear is me dying during birth. I met with a maternal fetal medicine specialist, and she said that I would be high risk, but could give birth. She would prefer it to be a natural birth, and would want to avoid a emergency c-section (which has worried the heck out of me, because isn't an emergency c-section by definition only done during an emergency??). My other big concern, is whether I'm stupid to even try to have a natural baby. Although my doctors say that it's possible for me to safely have a child, I wouldn't want to set myself up for a premature birth and/or set my child up for an unhealthy life. I've binged some youtube series of women documenting their pregnancy/birth experience with IBD / ostomy, but I'm hoping that you folks can help me add a few more data points to my decision making process.

My doc and I have considered surgery for the fissure, but it’s possible that if I tried surgery, it may not heal if Crohn’s is the reason it hasn’t healed and I’d be in worse shape. But it’s also possible that the fissure is unrelated to Crohn’s and surgery might be the solution, in which case going on a biologic would be a big risk for nothing. 

All this has us considering a biologic to know for sure if we can get this healed on its own.

Thank you in advance for your help!

383,Stelara,Starting Biologics.. Advice for nerves?,"Hi All, as the title suggests I will be starting Biologics in the next month (Stelera). I unfortunately have no experience with any effects of medication as I took an allergic reaction to Imuran on the first try, which has ruled me out of trying any other tablet forms.. 

Because I had this reaction, although it was mild, I am extremely nervous that I'll take a reaction to Stelara. I know the first infusion will be in hospital, but what if I develop a reaction after I leave?

Has anyone had a similar experience but been fine on Biologics? 

Also any advice on questions I need to be asking my doctors now? I have a bit of a list (long term effects, pregnancy, change of plans if this doesn't work etc), but worried I'm missing something important.

Thanks guys!

384,Stelara,"New to Crohn’s, symptoms may be improving while I wait for medicine?","Hi everyone,

As the title implies, I’m newly diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. I initially went to the doctor because I’d had diarrhea/soft stool every day for a couple months and painful gas accompanied by a wave of nausea frequently. I finally decided to go when I had intense pain in the lower right portion of my stomach.

I was diagnosed after a stool test, bloodwork, colonoscopy/biopsies. My GI wants to start me on stelara but I’m currently delayed in starting due to my insurance company initially denying it. 

However, it seems some of my gi specific symptoms are subsiding? I don’t really have stomach pain much and my bm’s seem to be more normal consistency and less frequent (although I went days without one recently so not sure if it’s switching to more constipation?). My biggest issue currently is back and thigh muscle pain so bad I need to take Tylenol every 6 hours or I can hardly walk normally.

So my question is: has anyone else experienced symptoms coming and going on their own without meds? And has anyone’s primary/most prominent symptom actually somewhere else in their body?

**just seeing anyone else has had a similar experience. Not asking for medical advice or anything like that. TIA!**",2024-08-02 15:41:13,CrohnsDisease,3,1eida5x,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1eida5x/new_to_crohns_symptoms_may_be_improving_while_i/,2024-08-02
385,Stelara,I hate my IBD team,"I don’t know if I’m just being a bit dramatic because this flare up is making me depressed, or if I’m valid for feeling this way, but I just needed to vent somewhere where other people share the same experiences. 
I’ve been diagnosed for 15 years, I went through the transition to adult services 5 years ago and it’s been so bad. I’m from the UK so I’m lucky enough to have the NHS and I get that they’re severely underfunded and under a lot of pressure but my god, the actual nurses from my local IBD are awful. 

I went on vedo last year, had a colonoscopy, was told that everything looked good. My symptoms got significantly worse when they tried to move me to every 8 weeks, I contacted the IBD team, they moved my infusions back down to once a month, I continued to get worse for 8 months. I contacted them in April about my worsening symptoms again and they asked me to send them stool samples and they did bloods. They contacted me two months later after I called them (after sending in a third sample, and not hearing anything back), and they confirmed I was having a flare up and they had had my results of all of my samples a couple of days after I had sent them. They told me that my GI wanted to do another colonoscopy since my calprotectin had risen so much in each sample I gave them, but it would take a while to get an appointment because I have to have it under anaesthetic due to PTSD and a traumatic experience during a previous colonoscopy.  

I didn’t hear anything from them again until this week where they told me that they didn’t want to  do a colonoscopy now because they did one last year (when they said I was in remission) and it was fine. I told them that my symptoms are significantly worse and I think that I’m anaemic (I’ve been anaemic enough times to know by now). I got up to and over 10 times a day and there’s a significant amount of blood in all of my stools. Sometimes it’s only blood. I can’t walk from one end of my bed to the other without having to sit down because I feel so breathless and faint. I feel dizzy and faint when I stand up in one spot. I have horrendous pain and insomnia despite being exhausted. I struggle to even hold my phone sometimes and I haven’t been able to leave my house in two months. My mum has to come over and wash my hair because I can’t stand up for too long and I’m too exhausted. If I shower I’ll sleep for two days straight. I told them this and more and they told me that I wasn’t anaemic back in April (when my symptoms weren’t as bad as they are now and my markers were also lower), so they have no plans to do my bloods again. 
I just really don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I’m too exhausted to cry about this but I’m so depressed. I’m in my early twenties and I can’t go anywhere or do anything. I haven’t been able to eat a proper meal since the start of the year, I’m losing weight, my brain fog is so intense that I struggle to form sentences and I do things like put my washing machine on without any clothes inside. And the IBD team tells me “yeah you’re having a flare up but we don’t want to do tests or anything”, and there’s nothing that I can do outside of move outside of the 40 mile radius that they operate in. 

I just don’t see the point in anything anymore, and this isn’t even the first time. When I had an adverse reaction to stelara they accused me of lying and were so rude that I broke down crying, to which they told me to call the Samaritans lol. I actually dread having to communicate with them and it really stresses me out lmao and if I could I would honestly just take my chances with being completely unmedicated and out of their care if it wasn’t cutting my nose off in spite of my face.",2024-08-02 04:27:24,CrohnsDisease,17,1ei142a,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1ei142a/i_hate_my_ibd_team/,2024-08-02

I’ve previously failed multiple treatment modalities including remicade, 6mp, lialda, and prednisone. I was put on Stelara 2 years ago after being very ill on remicade, and it quite literally saved my life. I had my 2 year surveillance colonoscopy and endoscopy yesterday which showed I am now in endoscopic remission! I am so freaking grateful and humbled rn.

389,Stelara,Newly diagnosed with Crohn’s. A few questions… (long post),"Hi everyone, a little background (sorry it’s long):

*Please note: I’m not seeking any medical advice. I’m very communicative with my healthcare team. I’m just seeing if anyone else has similar symptoms or has been in a similar situation.*

I’ve had history with random pain issues that come and go since 2017 (bad enough that  whatever part of my body was hurting would become immobile and I’d want medical attention immediately). Always went through a series of tests, doctors, and scans, but no one could ever tell me why I was in excruciating pain (mostly joints; shoulder, jaw, ankles, back). The worst experience of my life was having bilateral sacroilitis that popped up out of nowhere. Through all these experiences, all doctors couldn’t find anything explicitly wrong in my bloodwork/scans/etc. so they’d just send me to PT and it’d eventually get better for a while (sometimes years), but something else would always happen. 

Back in December, around Christmas, I started getting very painful gas accompanied by a quick wave nausea that only lasted a few seconds. Didn’t think much of it. Then, diarrhea started a little after that. This was not normal for me, however I’m sorta anxious and I have frequent bowel movements when I am nervous, and I was going through some high stress Feb-May, so again I didn’t think much about it. Also during this time I had a slight pain/muscle pull feeling in my stomach near the right of my belly button. 

I went to my primary doctor in June when the feeling in my stomach turned to stabbing pain out of nowhere. She sent me to gastro. Gastro diagnosed crohns after doing a colonoscopy asap after receiving my stool test results.

I’m currently waiting to hopefully be approved for stelara per my gastro’s recommendation, but (of course) in the middle of some insurance issues.

FINALLY onto my questions:
• I still have pain in my stomach but currently it seems more concentrated on the left side. Does anyone else’s stomach pain seem to move around?

• My left leg has been hurting since June but now it seems to be the primary issue. It’s currently worse than my stomach pain. It hurts to lift it and I sorta limp. I have to take Tylenol every 6 hours every day. Hurts to put my pants on etc. And the left side of my lower back felt bruised to the touch. At first it felt like my hip/groin. Then I noticed my back joined in. Now it feels like the muscles in my thigh are SO SORE. By the end of the night I feel like I’m pulling myself up the stairs with my arms. Has anyone had symptoms in their legs like this?

Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

Now I understand a few days of inflammation spike doesn't mean much without testing/consultation with my GI, but that reminded me of something I read on here about someone being on two maintenance meds at once, so I'm curious - how many of you have had two at once?

My doctor knows how long I was waiting and didn't express much concern about antibodies, I just kinda feel scared it won't work anymore.

397,Stelara,Nomad Life and Crohns,"

I've already used up my year's amount of Sick days at work and don't get any more. I've been burned before at my previous job by going on Short Term Disability that was initially approved for several months and suddenly not approved while I was still out and not doing any better. (Had to get attorneys involved.)

I've been looking through older posts but a lot of what I've been finding much applicable to my current situation. I'm currently employed full-time and have insurance and live in a house but before the end of the year I will be essentially homeless and not longer able to keep the current job. I intend to file for COBRA to keep the insurance or use the insurance marketplace but it is currently up in the air where I will end up. 

I'm currently on Stelara that is not quite keeping me pain free but I suppose at least better than if I was not. From what I have been reading online though, it seems like without the support network attached to insurance and a job, I'm screwed when it comes to getting my medicine. I'm sorry this is a bit rambly. I also have ADHD which is untreated because I live in Ohio and we can no longer legally get telehealth for this...  

  
It seems like the best thing I can do is discuss the situation with my GI doctor while I still have coverage. Would it be weird to ask if there are other medicine options that are more travel friendly. 

Once I no longer have the job, my husband and I are mostly going to be living out of the car traveling the US and then Mexico. We are hoping to find a better situation while living on a shoestring budget off of our savings. 

I don't know if anyone hear has any experience or advice but I haven't been finding much useful information searching online for advice traveling with Crohn's. I'm not sure if I'd be better off applying for disability. Main thing is I'm a bit overwhelmed. Don't really have a support network of any kind and don't know where to even start.",2024-06-22 19:12:15,CrohnsDisease,2,1dm33oj,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dm33oj/nomad_life_and_crohns/,2024-06-22
398,Stelara,Cannabis use disorder? ,"Hey folks, I’m seeing a fair number of people here talking about using THC to relieve their CD symptoms, especially nausea and lack of appetite. I’m newly diagnosed but this is consistent with my experience managing these symptoms. I have only just become aware that it’s been masking Crohn’s which I’m now realising has been an issue since childhood although didn’t really become unmanageable until about 7 years ago when I had a Protozoa infection make my guts go haywire. It’s taken years and years of living in survival mode before finally getting this diagnosis and understanding what’s really going on inside.

So this whole time, I’ve had this guilty narrative around my cannabis use which began with a heavy bong-head phase in my early 20s and has evolved over their years into more healthy, selective use through medically prescribed strains, though all this time I thought I was treating byproducts of anxiety manifesting in gut issues. Whilst being cognisant that it also has some paradoxical effects on my anxiety and can increase it with heavy use. 

I thought the nausea and lack of appetite were some kind of cosmic punishment for smoking too much weed, but I’m now realising that I smoke “too much” weed to manage symptoms when my Crohn’s is flaring and my tolerance to cannabis is high. I’ve quit so many times and felt the benefits of that state without the side effects THC brings, but with undiagnosed, unmanaged Crohn’s it’s felt impossible to sustain long term. I when I started budesonide I did find it much easier to taper off the cannabis but symptoms returned and and I’m now using it more heavily again whilst I wait to start Stelara. 

I recognise that I now have two issues to address - Crohn’s as well as cannabis use disorder. I wondered though, how have people gone about untangling these issues? Understanding that Crohn’s is influenced by stress, and abstaining from cannabis is stressful and also has short term impact on appetite and nausea increasing, it feels almost impossible? 

I’m no doubt using the cannabis to manage other stressors too: in the year leading up to my diagnosis, I went through the breakdown of a 13 year relationship, came to terms with being an independent adult for the first time since moving out of home with my former partner, at a time where I am still struggling to build a stable career, received a new adhd diagnosis, and although I’ve had a fairly positive experience socially, I’ve also come out as transgender and been working my way through a lot of mental challenges where that’s concerned. And now, coming to terms with my IBD diagnosis and the lifestyle implications of being immunosuppressed for the rest of my life as well. 

It feels like I’m in between a rock and a hard place, on the one hand I have to get my Crohn’s into remission, but on the other hand, I have all these stressors which affect my Crohn’s, and then there’s weed in the middle, seemingly helping me.. and hurting me. I really don’t know what the answer is or what standard I should even hold myself to. Perhaps I need to let go of the guilt and shame with my cannabis use and accept that it’s an effective part of managing symptoms? Am I being too hard on myself or is there a better way forward? When my tolerance gets too high and not even THC will help, it’s a really scary place to be so in some ways I feel like not having it to depend on at all might be better? 

Sorry this is a bit of a rant but I’d love to have better insight into what other people living with Crohn’s experience as far as cannabis goes. Thanks in advance! ",2024-06-16 02:59:54,CrohnsDisease,31,1dgy89y,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dgy89y/cannabis_use_disorder/,2024-06-16

400,Stelara,Flares whilst in treatment ,"Hello all! Apologies for the long over-sharing post. I appreciate this community and your knowledge of the condition greatly. 

I'm looking for some personal experiences to help my considerations of my current state.

I was diagnosed around 2 years ago. (Crohn's/UC - not defined as large bowel ulceration only but histology suggested Crohn's, presentation is more akin to UC. Somewhat academic due to treatment being the same.)

I was started on Adulimumab, which did nothing, switched to Influximab which worked wonders until my lovely immune system decided it was allergic to it, and I have been on Ustekinimab (Stelara) for almost a year now. Whilst the latest drug has everything seemingly under control (never felt it was quite as effective as the Influximab but it's definitely been good enough) I'm getting concerned I might be going into a flare. 

I've not been in anything I recognise as a flare since I started the Influximab, so I'm not sure when to be concerned or not. 

In the last 2-3 weeks I've started to be unusually tired, drained and feeling a bit off. My last blood test around a month ago didn't flag anything. 

In the last few days I've started having more frequent bowel movements but for the most part they have been solid. Today I went for a wee and had a bit of unexpected liquid stool at the same time. 

I intend to give a stool sample and have another blood test despite it being so close to my last one, but I am wondering if I'm just being over cautious. 

I've never had a c.diff infection so don't know what that is like. 

I've been ridiculously fortunate in that I don't seem to have any food restrictions associated with the disease. 

So onto the ask... Those with experience of flares, what flags it to you as an issue? How do you spot them and do I have to resign myself to another steroid course?

402,Stelara,Shingles vaccine while on a high-dose prednisone taper before starting a biologic?,"Hi friends, my GI is recommending that I get Shingrix asap, before starting hopefully Entyvio or Stelara in the next month or so. I’m reading that the second Shingrix dose should be given 2-6 months after the first, or could be given as soon as 1 month after if it would be better for the patient, which is going to be tricky in itself with the timeline — 

But what I’m wondering more about now is that I’m on an 8-week prednisone taper that started at 40mg and continues for another 5 weeks. I just finished the 30mg and I go down to 25mg tomorrow. Everything I’m seeing about Shingrix says it can be used in folks who are on 20mg or less, but that there’s no guidance for people who are on higher doses of pred.

I’m going to double check with GI, but does anyone have experience with either being on a higher pred dose and getting the Shingrix vaccine and/or trying to rush the Shingrix process before starting a biologic?",2024-06-05 20:50:13,CrohnsDisease,2,1d90i4s,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d90i4s/shingles_vaccine_while_on_a_highdose_prednisone/,2024-06-05
403,Stelara,"Newly diagnosed, trying to get my head around this? ","So, it’s only really just sinking in that I have a chronic autoimmune disease. My symptoms have been ongoing and undiagnosed for many years, so I’m used to living with this, and my symptoms have been a problem but relatively moderate in comparison to what I hear other people with Crohn’s experience? For me, it’s been mainly; frequent nausea, lack of appetite, diarrhoea. Fatigue and abdominal cramps sometimes. Occasional vomiting. It took years to diagnose because my inflammation is so mild it barely showed up on endoscopies and ultrasound, and was only confirmed by MRI. 

I was I initially prescribed budesonide and this did help a fair bit, although symptoms weren’t totally resolved and came back when I tapered off. My GI explained that azathioprine isn’t tolerated very well and I may do better on Stelara. I really have no basis for making my own assessment of my choices here, and I’m pretty freaked out by the risks associated with the medication. 

I’ve been told I’ll be on this medication for life, and failure to treat the Crohn’s would result in worse outcomes down the track. I feel like if my disease presentation were more obvious like what I’ve seen others describe, it would be easy to accept but for where I am at currently, I can’t help but wonder if the cure is worse than the disease? I’m also having a hard time reconciling how untreated Crohn’s could lead to colon cancer, but one of the risks of treating Crohn’s with Stelara is… cancer? 

Because it’s only moderate disease too, I’m kind of worried like.. what if I was misdiagnosed? It took multiple endoscopies and medical imaging over 15 years to reach this diagnosis, so if it was so hard to detect for so long, I can’t help but wonder if it might be something else and beginning treatment for Crohn’s might not be appropriate and worsen outcomes? 

Sorry, this is a bit of an anxious rant. I’m just having a hard time getting a handle on what this is all about, and struggling to accept it when it doesn’t look anywhere near as debilitating as it is for other people.

404,Stelara,I traveled to Europe with Crohn’s,"I wanted to share my story because when I was battling with doctors and in and out of hospitals trying to figure out what was happening to me, I thought all my plans of traveling the world were gone forever. But I did it and hope this can be a bright light to everyone else feeling the same way. 

I was in active Crohn’s undiagnosed for 2 years. In horrible pain, visiting doctor after doctor, in and out of the hospital. I was constantly told I “must have ovarian cysts” even when there was no proof on ultrasounds. They also thought it would be an ectopic pregnancy every time I went to the hospital. 
But low and behold after two years, finally finding a doctor who took me seriously, I had Crohn’s disease. 

Once diagnosed I started taking the Stelara injections every 8 weeks. It took around 6-10 months for the Crohn’s symptoms to lessen and after 2 years on the medication I am in remission. I still watch what I eat and balance my stress levels as best I can but I have no active Crohn’s! 

My wedding was 2 months ago now and we planned a honeymoon for Europe and I was very nervous. But I prepared as much as I could. I packed tons of Imodium and pepto and brought bread with me (my safe food) on the flights. Also when my Crohn’s was active I would have an adult diaper in my purse or car or something because on 2 occasions I was not able to make it to a bathroom in time. So I pack some of those also which luckily I never needed. 

On international flights the planes are much bigger so there are a lot more bathrooms (like 6-10) so when I needed to use one there was always one open. Then we landed in Italy and had to take a train to a port town where we would get on a cruise and the train station had bathrooms and so did the train its self. However I will say most places you have to pay to use the bathroom (1 euro) so I always carried change on me. 

Taking a cruise was the safest idea to me, to always have a “homebase” where I would have a bathroom I’m comfortable with and a bed to rest. I recommend to try a cruise for your first international travel if you are scared too. It was an awesome experience. After our 8 day cruise to other ports in Europe, we traveled Italy a bit on our own and I never had a hard time finding a bathroom, even in smaller non-touristy towns. 

And eventually our honeymoon came to an end and we returned home. 4 years ago I would have never thought this was possible so I hope this inspires a few people on here too. I am only 23 years old and hopefully this is the first of many international travels.

405,Stelara,Low Carb for Biologic Weight Gain?,I've been on Stelara (Remicade prior to that).  Biologic medications are proven to cause weight gain because they mess with your metabolism and affect your insulin resistance.  I am wondering if anyone has had any success losing weight while on a biologic medication?  I gain weight so quickly.

407,Stelara,New to the group and new to treatment! I'm nervous.,"Hello everybody, I was hoping to get a few word of encouragement or even as much advice as you could give.

I'm 30(f) and I was just diagnosed with crohns anout 3 or so months and so far its been super stressful. I have had 2 colonoscopies, on my second dose of prednisone due to the amount of inflammation, and have had to fight with insurance to even begin treatment (Stelara).

Today, I just got a call from the Stelara case worker that I have been approved for the medications and she was going to be applying for the assists program to help with the cost (been waiting for about 2 months). She told me that I should be getting a call in the next few days to set up my first infusion and I have no idea how to feel or expect.

Question 1: What should I expect from the first round of treatment, and would being on the prednisone affect it?

Question 2: The only way that I have been able to eat is with THC for not only appetite but for unbearable pain from the smallest amount of food. Would this cause issues with treatment?

Question 3: Approximately how long did it take for you to see improvement with the treatment? I ask this because my Dr is making me feel like it might be the ""cure-all"" for my symptoms but I know everybody has a different experience if how fast the medication has worked for them.

This is all the questions I have for now, thank you all in advance for anything you can give!",2024-05-22 00:23:05,CrohnsDisease,5,1cxn6ih,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cxn6ih/new_to_the_group_and_new_to_treatment_im_nervous/,2024-05-22
408,Stelara,Anyone diagnosed with Gastroduodenal or Jejunal Crohn's that did not show up on MRI ?,"I posted about this awhile back and did not get much response but I am gaslighting myself and need people who have gone through this or similar to help me be objective.

I will Try to keep this brief but it's a lot.

-long history of stricturing  Crohn's of terminal ileum diagnosed in 2006. First resection  Sept 2018, Last resection in April 2022.  Surgeon told me he found Crohn's high up in small bowel, could not remove safely, hoped new biologic (Stelara) would take care of it.

-6 month delay in starting Stelara due to GI F up (forgot to send preauthorization)

-July 2022 began having severe upper gastric pain (under ribs and belly button) after even the smallest amount of food, followed by severe nausea and often vomiting.  Within half hour multiple liquid BM's undigested food and insane amount of fluid.  Began to eat less and less, moved to soft diet, and finally to complete liquids in August 2023

-July 2023-Oct 2023- Weight loss of 20 lbs over 3 month period.  Many ER visits needed for rehydration and IV anti emetics and pain meds as could not keep down any oral meds.  GI did colonoscopy but only found microscopic Crohn's in anastomosis site (he only took 2 biopsies from that area and nowhere else). CT's done in hospital showed thickening of wall of ascending colon, and collapsed bowel, free fluid in peritoneum. GI dismissed as ""not reliable"".  Fecal Cal slightly elevated.  Constant low grade anemia. After 4th ER visit in Oct 2023 they did a high res Ultrasound and I was admitted by surgery department.  However, as I was urgent but not emergent, there were no beds available.  Was given choice of staying in ER and receiving IV steroids, or going home and following up with GI.  Chose home and was given Entocort.  Entocort slowed down bowel from 30-50 bm's a day to ten.  Did not help pain, nausea, vomiting, lack of ability to eat.  After several desperate emails where I begged for help, said I wanted to die-GI ordered urgent MRI, would not change meds or give prednisone without ""proof"".

-November 2023-Began to experience fatigue like never before.  Could hardly keep eyes open.  This would be followed by severe upper gastric pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that went on for days, followed by constipation for 1-2 days and severe bloating, only on the left side of belly which would be rock hard and hot to the touch.  Then the diarrhea cycle woud begin again.  Always pure liquid, sometimes black, always tons of mucous.

-Went to Mexico to visit my parents for the holidays where I usually feel better but still could not eat.  Injecting myself with IM Gravol (anti emetic) just to keep fluids down.  I lived off of chicken broth with rice. Saw GI in private hospital.  Ordered full workup.  Blood found in stool.  3 D CT ordered (could not find a vein for IV after 5 nurses, two doctors, and a radiologist with a vein finder so only had oral contrast) showed inflammation in small bowel, thickening of the ascending colon wall 11 mm, and inflammation of ileum.  He wanted to send me to special IBD hospital in Mexico City for MRI but it would have cost 2500$ so I decided to wait till I got home to Canada where it would be free.  Treated me with antibiotics for IBS (only available in Mexico and Germany) Zero improvement.  I lived off of electrolyte drinks.

-Jan 29th 2024 returned to hospital because I could not keep any oral meds in (pills would be in toilet) also pain was 9/10, high fever, vomiting.  Admitted again, but no beds.  Left AMA with another prescription for Entocort.

-Feb 12 2024- High fever followed by two days of 40 plus liquid BM's, some of them bloody, all of them black.  Husband insisted back to ER where I was admitted immediately.  Cortisol levels 11 (close to adrenal failure) very low potassium.  Doc said if we'd waited I likely would have died from heart event.  Spent 8 + weeks in hospital having every kind of test imaginable.  NOTHING showed on MRI, inflammation on CT, lower scope clear, upper endoscopy showed inflammation in esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.  Negative for H Pylori, negative for celiac.  Started on 150 mg of hydrocortisone for low cortisol to rescue my organs.  MRI of brain showed small tumour on pituitary.  Endocrinologist did ACTH test and was unhappy, kept me on 40 mg of hydrocortisone IV.  PICC line insertion went awry when they Discovered I had complete stenosis of veins and needed port catheter surgically implanted.  Was on TPN for 5 weeks.  Needed pain meds and anti emetics every 4 hours or severe vomiting and diarrhea would ensue.  30-50 liquid bm's continued (they made me write down everything I ingested and every time I had a BM.  They tested me for everything. No blood,   NO CDiff, no parasites, no infection.  High fever 104.5 plus delirium and CRP shot up to 50.  Continued Anemia, blood work all over the place, even with TPN I needed potassium and sodium boluses 3 times a day.  

-Requested pill endoscopy, GI said no Crohn's, no need for test.  Suggested psych evaluation for a fucking eating disorder.  Endocrinologist disagreed, said starvation and whatever disease process was causing symptoms was causing my cortisol issue. Psych diagnosed medical PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder (no shit) but NO eating disorder.  Fired GI and hired IBD specialist from another city.  Re ran all tests, CT showed huge diverticulum on duodenum otherwise clear.  Was going to be moved to a ward from a private room.  Had a panic attack because I could not share a bathroom and was not about to use a commode.  Asked to be discharged after nearly 9 weeks.  They were so overcrowded and basically did not know what else to do to help me, so they let me go even though I was still on TPN and NPO.  Got a 5 minute instruction on how to insert a butterfly catheter for pain meds, and let go.

-Present-3 weeks later, still on liquid diet, (Boost drinks, blended oatmeal, yoghurt and soup) still on sub q and IM meds.  Finally got new IBD doc to order capsule endoscopy and is treating me for SIBO (never been tested) plus set me up with nutritionist and psychologist for support. MRI repeated- totally clear.  

I FEEL CRAZY.  This is the sickest I have ever felt.  It's been almost a year since I chewed food. The pain under my ribs just to the left of my belly button is now constant, whether I eat or not, pain meds barely take the edge off.  Sometimes it's so intense I can hardly breathe.  I keep passing out on the toilet.  I projectile vomit daily, even using Gravol and Pantoprozole, the bile acid is awful.   I've been doing tons of research and have learned that GDC and Jejunal Crohn's are extremely hard to diagnose.  I have every single symptom and fit the criteria.

410,Stelara,Rinvoq vs Remicade,"My fiancé was diagnosed with Crohn’s when he was 12 and we’re currently in the hospital with what we thought was a regular flare. He usually responds to liquid steroids, but we’ve been here since Tuesday morning and the pain is still the same.

He’s been on Humera, Stelara, Rinvoq, and now they’re considering switching him to Remicade. Stelara put him almost in remission for 5 years, but we had a scare last year when he went into septic shock and was in a coma for 4 days and the ICU for 12 days. I think the chiropractor had something to do with it, but his GI doctor is afraid to put him back on Stelara out of fear that might happen again. They never could pinpoint a reason for that visit, but I have my suspicions about the chiropractor. 

My question is, has anyone ever switched from Rinvoq to Remicade? What was your experience? Also, what can I do to help him feel better? I feel so helpless and appreciate any input anyone would be able to give 🩷",2024-05-09 16:20:20,CrohnsDisease,5,1co17xo,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1co17xo/rinvoq_vs_remicade/,2024-05-09
411,Stelara,OTC alternatives to colestyramine/questran ?,"I wondered if anyone know of/have experiences with alternatives to questran/colestyramine that do not require a prescription?

I regularly read here about people benefiting tremendously from using a bile acid sequester, yet where I live this appears to be not commonly used in CD (if any Dutchies have experienced otherwise, I'd love to hear). I think I have good reasons to believe I might benefit from trying this, but my GI seems to ignore my suggestion in this direction. Last week, I did get my stelara frequency increased from 6 to 4 weeks which I am hopeful about but I can't really shake the idea that a bile acid binder could be worth to try also/first.

A deep dive in literature yielded several decades old papers suggestion that magnesium hydroxide (widely available as OTC acid reflux remedies maalox/antagel/gastilox) might serve as a (slightly less potent) alternative to colestyramine, while one blog mentioned something called chitosan (a substance often marketed as a fat burner :/).

I know that there have been shortages of colysteramine in recent years and I imagine that some people here may have tried alternatives to tide them over.

Her appetite is down and she constantly complains (every couple days) ""My tummy hurts."" What's weird is that the last time we got near the 8 week mark she complained of joint pain in her wrists, feet, legs, etc. and those went away within a day of getting the Stelara injection.

414,Stelara,Advice,"Hi,
I’m looking for advice given all the colective experience and knowledge of this group. 

I (M60) was diagnosed with Crohn’s during a routine colonoscopy last year (mild inflamation), without having any symptoms. Only thing out of order in blood work was gasca (53) and mri (questionable mild thickening terminal ileum). Calprotectin also normal.

Did second colonoscopy 6 months later, showed inflamation and I was having mild symptoms ( more BMs, softer stools, more flatulence).
Started with Budesonide 9mg, improved first 3 weeks but then same symptoms but worse (still no diarrhea or any kind of pain)

Started eliminating foods until figured out problem was lactose. 

Currently I’m down to Budesonide  6mg a day, working out and eating clean (almond milk, coffee, oats, yogurt, aged cheese, lean meats, beans, raw and cooked fruits and vegetables, kind of IBD AID phase 3 diet) and I’m back to almost normal. Just some stomach grumbling after meals and heaviness/ more and softer BMs when I don’t eat clean. 

Dr suggested go to entyvio or remicade. I said entyvio because it’s more specific for the guts and I do not  have any skin or joint pain.
Talked to another Dr who suggested stelara due to being injections instead of infusions, more specific for Crohn’s and less side effects. Second blood work is all normal.
In the meantime insurance approved entyvio.

Based on your experiece:
- Should I really start a biologic?
- If I do, which one would be better for my situation: stelara or entyvio? (Also read entyvio should be left as a 2nd option)
- If I don’t, should I try any other medication? Or just diet and close monitoring?

Thanks in advance!

415,Stelara,Looking for advice when potentially switching medications,"Hello fellow UC/CD patients! I am at a crossroads in my medication journey and I am wondering if anyone has any experience being in a position like mine and can give me some advice. Quick context as to why I'm posting this on both the UC and CD subreddits: I see two GI doctors and my main GI thinks I have Crohn's Colitis (CD localized in the colon) and my secondary GI thinks I have Ulcerative Colitis.

Both of my GIs (especially my main one) are worried about my ongoing intestinal inflammation, which has been a constant for the last 5 years (aside from times that I have been on Prednisone when it got out of hand). I am at increased risk of colon cancer due to this constant inflammation, as well as the formation of pseudo-polyps that the inflammation has caused.

They both have provided me with a few different directions moving forward:

1. Continue with my current medication Rinvoq
2. Switch to the new and novel drug Velsipity
3. Try two combined therapies I have tried before (Rinvoq + Stelara)
4. Try the drug Skyrizi, which is similar to Stelara
5. Get a permanent ostomy bag

I am heavily leaning towards one of the first two choices, and would be happy to go ahead and try Velsipity and then switch back to Rinvoq if it isn't effective, but something that my doctor said makes me hesitate. He said that when getting off a drug for an extended period of time there is a chance the body will not take to it with the same effectiveness if it is reintroduced. This worries me because Rinvoq is the best medication I have found so far at giving me back control of my life. There is still moderate ongoing inflammation, but this is the most symptom free I have been on any non-steroid drug after 6+ months. Please let me know any advice you may have.",2024-04-26 21:07:16,CrohnsDisease,2,1cdwmwk,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cdwmwk/looking_for_advice_when_potentially_switching/,2024-04-26

Had a question about people's Fecal Calprotectin levels. I'm currently on Stelara and I'm doing an annual check-up with my GI. I got some bloodwork done and a FC test. Bloodwork came back relatively normal (slightly anemic since last year but was actually slowly getting better and CRP levels are good), but FC levels were slightly high. Last year I clocked in at 38mcg/g (which is actually pretty low!) but this year I clocked in at 68, which I know is slightly higher than the cutoff range (50). My CRP levels were normal, but I've been also having some IBS symptoms and my stomachs been a little off due to stress about these tests. I know some online sources that for IBD, you can still be considered in remission at around 100-150 mcg/g but I'm not sure if that's clinical remission or histological remission. Will be seeing my doctor due to the results. As an IBD patient, I'm sure we all try to aim for complete histological remission if possible but I was wondering about anyone else's experience with FC tests being slightly elevated and such?",2024-04-10 20:22:12,CrohnsDisease,3,1c0vitw,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1c0vitw/fc_questions/,2024-04-10

Can folks share their experiences with liver biopsies?   I get a lot of anxiety about needles.  I have gotten pretty good at coping with IV's, but I'm pretty terrified by the description of a liver biopsy procedure.   I'd appreciate knowing what it's like from people's personal experiences.    

Also wondering, for folks who have had liver issues associated with Crohn's.... is it ever not awful, long-term health wise?    My colonoscopy showed ""no healthy tissue"" (I've since started Stelara).

423,Stelara,Terrified of taking medication-looking for some encouragement. ,"Alright, hello everyone! 
I have been lurking here for some time. I’ll try to keep this as short as I can. 
I have crohn’s, I was diagnosed in May 2023. Based off of my colonoscopy and how long active disease was happening before the diagnoses, they explained that I needed to go on a biologic stat.
I have always been pretty scared of meds (of any kind) and not very trusting of doctors/medical industry. Let alone a life long injection. The side effects scared me to no end.
 So I tried to “fix it” myself. (Please be kind about my ignorance, there was clearly some serious denial and lack of understanding) anyway,
for the last ten months, I have tried truly everything that I have ever read could be beneficial for Crohn’s/autoimmunity. Down to the sheets I sleep on at night. I never cheated. I have spent way too much time and money and I’m exhausted. 
This brings me to my recent hospital visit, a couple days ago. I cannot get to work(not the kind of job that has sick leave so this is not good) or leave my house really. Things are pretty bad. I have no life, outside of focusing on how to deal with this disease every day-it’s gotten very dark. 

So I’m like okay, this disease is probably worse untreated without the medication. I’m trying to get there. But then I go on the internet and scare myself all over again by reading side effects etc. 
I guess I’m just asking for honest reviews, if anyone has felt like me, your experience etc.  They are going to put me on stelara.

430,Stelara,My Experience,"Hey guys, I wanted to share my experience with this disease since it took a while for me to find someone with answers when I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.

I am a 27 year old male who had been diagnosed with Crohns disease back in August of last year. 

Starting 2020, I started having some stomach issues, i.e. diarrhea, cramping, more than a normal person should. I chalked it up to food intolerance and didn't think much of it. A few years go by and I eventually started forming periabal abscesses, what I originally thought were hemmorhoids. I tried treating them with hemmorhoid ointment for a while to no avail. Still, as stubborn as I was did not go see a doctor because everything I read about hemmoroids was that they were harmless and go away on their own. Additionally, I consistently started losing weight. From ages 18-24, I was a healthy 225 lbs. By the end of 2022, I was hovering around 195 with no explanation as to why I kept losing weight. I assumed it was because I wasn't working out as much anymore due to having a baby girl and work consuming most of my time 

Fast forward to the middle of last year, I started having severe stomach cramps, like curl up in the fetal position severe, pretty much every evening. I went to the doctor to have the abscess looked at by my primary care doctor and she explained to me that I was showing the beginning signs of sepsis. I went to the ER and they were shocked at how bad the inflammation was in my colon. They said that it was so bad that if I put it off another few months, I would've done irreparable damage to my body. The big problem here was that the doctors swore up and down that it was my appendix due to the location of the infection on my lower right abdomen. I went through a month of IV antibiotics and eventually started feeling better but after the infection started to subside, CT scans, still showed a ton of inflammation, which pointed the doctors towards crohns disease. I get a colonoscopy at the beginning of August to confirm the diagnosis. 

The GI said that a bowel resection was on the table considering how bad it was but I elected to try treatment first. Doctor says it is 50/50 if I will avoid surgery.

I am currently on Stelara every 8 weeks and have noticed improvements. I have finally started putting weight back on and the stomach pains have subsided I'd say by 90%. 

I am still very much learning about this disease and would appreciate other people's stories and what they are doing to combat this disease.

Nevertheless, the main reason why I wanted to put this out there was to remind everyone to not be stubborn when it comes to your health. Go see the damn doctor and listen to your body.

603,Skyrizi,Working with Crohn’s,"Hello fellow Crohnies,

   I am just wondering how many of you work and if you have ever felt discriminated against due to your condition. I’m in an interesting situation. I work for a luxury brand as a store manager. This has been my career since graduating college in 2002. 2 years ago I was recruited by a high end luxury brand and it seemed like a dream come true. Now 2 years in reality is setting in. It has been extremely stressful, dealing with poor treatment by male staff, when addressing the situation with my male Director, I was told that I need to alter my behavior and my absences make it hard to earn respect of the staff. Recently it has risen to the level of harassment, foul language used by the males, yelling and extremely aggressive behavior. When I again brought this up, my Director told me that “I work myself up over these interactions and am making myself sick and it’s my fault that I’m having issues with my Crohns. He told me that my issue is that I let it upset me and the anxiety and frustration is the problem. He refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of my situation and told me his mom has RA so we knows all about these things. This is entirely untrue, after 10 years my Remicade failed and I have switched to Skyrizi, still on my loading doses and those have been rough. After my first dose, I had a terrible reaction, I ended up hospitalized and missed a week of work, all excused and I have plenty of PTO. He made rude comments to the staff about me and told me if it happened again, he would wheel my hospital bed into the store and I could figure it out. The director also routinely cautions against going to HR and went as far to send a threatening message in our work chat if we “aired the dirty laundry” during a visit he would be “very disappointed.” We have 3 females and we are all treated the same by the same few men. First we were told it’s cultural, now the narrative is that we over react. I am usually the one that faces the most negative treatment due to my illness. I have had this disease for 30 years and have never experienced this kind of treatment. I’m just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and how you dealt with it if you did. I need the job, but my disease is the worst it has ever been and I’m not well enough to start the job hunt over again. I would love to hear both positive and negative experiences with working with this illness. Maybe I  am over reacting, help!!! It’s really starting to make me question myself and if I’m the crazy one here. He has told the entire staff that HR is only to protect the company and anyone who goes that route is stupid and doesn’t know how things “really work”. I know I’m not at my best when I’m flaring like this, so it is really messing with my head. Sorry the long post, I’m just really looking for other experiences, and what others have had to go through. Thank you in advance❤️",2024-09-04 23:40:30,CrohnsDisease,1,1f985uu,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1f985uu/working_with_crohns/,2024-09-04
604,Skyrizi,Are any mothers willing to share their pregnancy and birth experience while having Crohn’s disease and being on a biologic? ,"I want to preface by saying I plan on bringing this up with my PCP and GI at my next visits and discuss future plans in detail before trying for a baby. 

I am getting married next year, and my future husband and I plan on starting to try for a family after the wedding.. as long as I am still stable and in remission. 

I am currently on Skyrizi and doing well. I know Skyrizi is newer and there is not a lot of data on pregnancy with this particular biologic. Is anyone on Skyrizi and pregnant or had a safe pregnancy while on Skyrizi?

If you have been pregnant and have Crohn’s, what was your pregnancy like? Did you have more appointments and were you considered high risk? 

What was birth like for you? Did you have to have a c section or were you able to give birth vaginally? I have read that if you’ve ever had a fistula (I have) that majority of drs will recommend a C section to prevent potential risk of damaging the area again. This makes me a little sad as I would like to try to give birth vaginally but ultimately would go with whatever is safest for me and the baby and recommended by my drs. 

I am just trying to do some research and gather some information so that I can plan for this phase of life. I know of course everyone’s body is different and everyone’s experiences are unique, but I appreciate the responses. 💓",2024-09-02 00:52:09,CrohnsDisease,15,1f6u02w,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1f6u02w/are_any_mothers_willing_to_share_their_pregnancy/,2024-09-02
605,Skyrizi,Insurance approval for biologics - how hard is it to get?,"I was curious about other people’s experiences with getting insurance approval for treatment for Crohn’s. My spouse was recently diagnosed with Crohn’s after having to do a whole host of diagnostics (colonoscopy, plenty of lab work, and a CT scan) and the GI doctor initially submitted a prior authorization for Skyrizi, which was denied. The GI doctor is now submitting a prior authorization for Remicade, and I’m worried insurance won’t approve this either. Does insurance only approve these medications after taking things like steroids and immunomodulators? Or does it just depend on the insurance? We have pretty good insurance coverage, but I’m worried my spouse  will first have to get less effective treatment just to check some boxes from insurance before they approve better medications like biologics. He’s been in pain on and off for the better part of a year now while he’s been diagnosed, and I want him to get treatment that’s effective. He just started steroids temporarily, and he’s about to start azathioprine to pair with Remicade in anticipation it’s approved. Can anyone speak to their experience going through treatment options and insurance approvals? Also, if I’m misunderstanding anything, please say so. I’ve been doing research, but the Crohn’s diagnosis is still new for both of us.",2024-08-28 18:57:11,CrohnsDisease,1,1f3i9ij,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1f3i9ij/insurance_approval_for_biologics_how_hard_is_it/,2024-08-28
606,Skyrizi,Success story,"Hey all, just wanted to share some good news because I was at a really low place for a while and I wanted to show things can get better. Heres a timeline:

Age 19: experience symptoms, but am told I am too young to be sick for a month straight. Eventually feel good enough to function.

Age 25: symptoms return, lose 40 LBs. Schedule colonoscopy but after 3 months nothing found besides non cancerous polyps. Told to return in 10 years.

Age 28: Fistula and loose seton placed. Told I may have this forever. Colonoscopy shows small aphthous ulcers. Follow up in a year.

Age 29: Repeat colonoscopy, more aphthous ulcers. Officially diagnosed with Crohns. 

Age 30: Begin skyrizi, things begin to look up, loose seton ended up cutting to the point of being superficial. Seton removed. 

Age 32: For the first time in my life I lost weight because I wanted to through diet and excersie. I am even able to eat a diet high in fiber now! Went from 245 to 185. CRP is undetectable, white blood cell count is half what it has ever been in my life. All labs in a perfect range, and only 1 bowel movement a day. Most importantly, just welcomed my first child!


I just want to post this because I went through a decade of not knowing what is wrong , thinking I could never get better, thinking I would live with setons and other things forever.

Right now they're on Skyrizi, and it seems to be going really well, only the 3 loading doses and one at home dose but it's managing them great so far.

I (27M) got diagnosed about 2 years ago. My doc immediately got me on Hyrimoz (im in Canada) and its been a rollercoaster since then. Hyrimoz worked for about 2 months and since then me and my doc have been trying different doses. I recently did a re-induction and it helped for 2 weeks but faded after that. So clearly its not really work and we might move to Skyrizi.

Currently I dont have pain, but I do have some bleeding and I go to the bathroom quite often (roughly 10 per day). We discussed prednisone and my doctor said unless it was absolutely necessary he would rather avoid putting a steroid in my body at my age. 

That being said, I think it might be time to look into prednisone. Im about to start a renovation job so im gonna he on the move a lot.

622,Skyrizi,Just Need to Vent,"I’m really over having this disease. With or without medication, it’s so much management and so much to deal with. 

I think more recently, this resection and getting my infusions in order took a lot out of me and I just feel so burnt out. I wouldn’t actually do anything, but I just always have that thought of what’s the point to keep going?

I’ve been in constant pain for 10 years because my parents wouldn’t allow me to get on biologics (which I was recommended for at my initial diagnosis), and while I feel slightly better post-resection (which was only 2 and a half weeks ago), I still feel uncomfortable and tired all the time.

Not to mention, having to deal with insurance. I’ve literally been trying to work with my GI, multiple pharmacies, my insurance, my PCP, and infusion centers to work everything out. For an entire week (the week after my surgery), I was on phone to try and get a fast track for prior authorization, overnight delivery, and asap scheduling for the infusion center just to get Skyrizi before I leave to go on a study abroad program. It was a very tight schedule with no room for error or delay, a very stressful few weeks.

It won’t even end there, I’ve had to fight with my college telling me that my Crohn’s isn’t serious enough to warrant accommodations of any kind for my physical condition. And when I go out of the country to study abroad, I already know there will be issues with my medication or my roommates/floor.

I can’t even find peace in a “vacation” of any sorts, I’m always in pain. 

I have to give up my dream college to be close to home because of this and financial strains that were caused by my Crohn’s issues.

And now I just learned that, since I’m back home from college (my college town is where I received all of my recent treatment), I have to get a new GI in my state. The main two good hospitals are hospitals that I’ve been to, both with me having bad experiences there that caused me PTSD. I don’t think I can handle going back, but my appointment is in 2 weeks.

And it’s not just medical stuff, Crohn’s has caused rifts in my family, caused so much judgement from people who don’t have Crohn’s, has caused me to lose relationships and friendships before, and is now putting pressure on my current relationship.

I’m just scared and so so tired. I don’t know what to do, especially when whatever energy and motivation that’s left right now runs out eventually and I don’t know how I’ll be mentally for that.",2024-07-10 03:08:32,CrohnsDisease,11,1dzlfwh,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1dzlfwh/just_need_to_vent/,2024-07-10

632,Skyrizi,TRT,"I saw a couple posts on this, and was wondering if anyone had any major experience with it.

Diagnosed with CD in my early 20s, now close to 40 and it's never really been under control. Multiple resections, been on tons of drugs.

Right now I am on Skyrizi + Rinvoq.


I started experiencing some of the effects of low t, tested it, and I hang around 150-200... which is just below the lower level threshold.

I asked my GI and my PCP about TRT, and both of them were like eh, don't worry about it.




Well, I am worried about it


I am just wondering if anyone with Crohn's has done this, and what kind of success they have had? Did it aggravate your Crohn's and subside your other symptoms?",2024-05-25 04:17:42,CrohnsDisease,2,1d03qlo,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d03qlo/trt/,2024-05-25
633,Skyrizi,Skyrizi (is it really working?),"I just had my 3rd infusion two weeks ago so I am a little over 2 months of being on Skyrizi. I had my calprotectin levels checked and it showed they are down to 45 which is within normal range. (Started at 165 before starting Skyrizi) the doctor said this means that the Skyrizi is working. Problem is none of my symptoms have really changed or gotten better. I’m still having stomach pain every morning when I wake up. Every single bowel movement is still diarrhea and painful. I still have no appetite and I’m still losing weight. I still have fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  If anything I have more/new symptoms now. I’ve been getting bad tension headaches since starting Skyrizi and a really sharp pain in my right upper abdomen near my gallbladder area that sent me to the ER last week. (Pain has been coming and going for a couple months. Just got bad enough finally to warrant an ER visit.) CT scan and bloodwork showed everything was normal. Had a hida scan test done and it also came back normal. I do have an upper scope scheduled for later this week but I have this gut feeling it’s gonna come back clean as well. So my question for those with experience on Skyrizi is could these all be side affects? Is there a chance that even tho my Calpro levels are normal that the Skyrizi may not be working? Im just feeling so defeated right now bc I had such high hopes I’d be feeling better by now based off all the good experiences ppl have had on Skyrizi.

634,Skyrizi,Remicade induced psoriasis - switch?,"Hi friends, 

I’ve been on remicade since 2012 and I feel so lucky and thankful that it’s keeping me in deep remission after over 10 years. 

A few months into treatment, it induced psoriasis plaques on my scalp; my GI referred me to a dermatology who agreed that it was most likely Remicade induced, but because of how well Remicade was working, his preference would be to try to manage it via topical route and low dose methotrexate so I could catch up on some growth during ages 11-16, as malnutrition severely stunted me from ages 6-11 before I got diagnosed. 

Fast forward to present day; I wasn’t followed by a dermatologist from 2019-2024 (just saw dermatologist yesterday!) because of ✨Canadian healthcare waitlist times for specialists✨. During this period of time my psoriasis spread to cover my scalp completely, and now covers my genital area and my armpits (some of my post history in r/psoriasis shows gross images of how bad it would get lol). The Dermatologist said that considering how little it’s responding to topicals, her preference would be to switch me to an IL-23 such as Skyrizi or Stelera which A. Should clear the psoriasis if it was remicade induced and B. Even if the psoriasis would stay slightly, they’re used to treat both Crohn’s and psoriasis, so high chances of it helping. 

My GI, so far, disagrees; she says that’s it’s my choice, but since skyrizi and Stelera are newer biologics for Crohn’s, it’s unknown to see whether or not they would flare me. It’s also obviously uncommon practise to switch therapies when it’s working so well for so long. 

I feel really conflicted and unsure. My psoriasis has taken a huge toll on my mental health from hair loss, bleeding, complications, pain, etc. But sometimes it’s tolerable if I consistently do my 45 minute scalp treatment in the mornings. It would be pretty life changing to have it go away after so many years of it affecting me, but my Crohn’s was so severe and difficult to control when I got diagnosed, and I’m already underweight to start with and I know it wouldn’t take long for me to be hospitalized if I flare. 

Has anyone ever done the switch from an anti TNF agent EVEN if it worked really well to control your Crohn’s? What was your experience like?

638,Skyrizi,Experiences with Crohn’s and blood thinners/anti-coagulant medications.,"I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease roughly 14-15 years ago and have been seeing the same GI since I received my diagnosis.  Recently I was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and have been told I need to have my aortic valve replaced in my heart.  After speaking between the cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and my gastroenterologist none of them seem to know what blood thinners may do to me with my Crohn’s, but all three doctors believe a mechanical valve is my best option because of my age (40).  If I get the mechanical valve, which is my current choice, I will be on blood thinners the rest of my life.  My GI said in his 27 years of practicing he’s never had a patient with both conditions.  He went as far as reaching out to the 7-8 other gastroenterologist colleges that work out of the same office, but that yielded nothing notable.  He believes we can aggressively treat the Crohn’s disease as any problems arise. 

What I’m asking is if there is anyone viewing this who has had any experience with having Crohn’s, who take blood thinners, and your experience with Crohn’s disease while on blood thinners?  

I ask this because I do have rectal bleeding off and on, during flares, etc.  I’m currently taking Skyrizi, between the 3 infusions and 1 obi, I’ve been taking it since November 2023.  I had a small intestinal resection of 11” the year I was first diagnosed, followed by five pocket abscesses forming around the resection area, and another hospital visit, nothing major since that time.  The heart valve issue was diagnosed this March and they’ve been moving relatively quickly to get me scheduled for surgery.  I’ve had an echocardiogram, CT scan, and a cardiac catheterization in addition to a slew of lab work.  The cardiologist believes my condition is due to a bicuspid valve that I was born with.",2024-04-24 15:22:14,CrohnsDisease,2,1cc0xvf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cc0xvf/experiences_with_crohns_and_blood/,2024-04-24

641,Skyrizi,Calprotectin normal after starting skyrizi. Does that mean my remaining symptoms are all IBS?,"TL;DR Calpro came back at 22 but I'm not feeling much better than before starting skyrizi


30M, I was diagnosed with crohns following hospitalization for bowel obstruction end of last year. 

I started Skyrizi in January and have finished my three in-hospital infusions. I saw my GI for a follow-up and just got my calprotectin results back, showing just 22 (!). I was at 600 following my hospital stay. 

The thing is, I had told my doctor I didn't feel like the drugs were working. My symptoms are gas, bloating, diarrhea once a week or so, mild cramping, and hemorrhoids. 

I've been dealing with similar symptoms for over a decade at this point, and was hoping that the Crohns diagnosis and treatment was a root cause. I had rather gotten my hopes up that the Skyrizi, if it worked, would make me feel better overall. 

I'm grateful that the skyrizi appears to be helping for inflammation. And I'm holding out hope that maybe these IBS-like symptoms are in fact caused by my crohns, and the inflammation just needs to be lower for longer before I start feeling an improvement. 

(Side note: I had my calpro tested several times over the years before my crohns diagnosis when I was experiencing upper GI symptoms, and they came back 800-1000, even when I wasn't having major intestinal symptoms)

650,Skyrizi,trouble losing weight with crohns - can a GI help?,"27f, 5'2. Newly on Skyrizi. Diagnosed in 2018 - but I've always had trouble losing weight even before the diagnosis. During my first flare, I lost a considerable amount of weight, but it actually got me down to a ""healthy"" weight range for me and everyone kept telling me how good i looked. lmao. 

Since then I've been in remission and had my thyroid checked, worked with a dietician, and have yoyod but at this point (after 3 years of working at it) am down a grand total of....6 lbs from my highest. I just had a flare that had me -10lb but now that I'm healing it's just steadily creeping back up. I was just in Europe for a week and walking 6-10 miles a day, eating less frequently (and less calorie dense foods) and came back +1lb. It's infuriating!

I've been working on my relationship with food - I realized I have a problem with binge eating snacks depending on my mood. I'm 10 wks clean of that and literally no difference haha. I have a calorie tracker app - a dietitian told me to shoot for 1400-1600 a day for a deficit and I MOSTLY achieve that. I also walk a lot. I know I should add strength training, that's next on my list. 

Anyway, I searched this thread for similar problems and have seen LOTS of us have this same issue. I want to ask tho - has anyone brought this up with their GI and has the GI been able to help? I have an appointment in a couple of weeks with my GI but I'm not sure if there's anything he can do, or if it would be more of a PCP issue?

I noticed a lot of people get put on steroids temporarily after their diagnosis to help with inflammation before they’re able to be put on biologics. Should my dr have done that? I’m confused bc she offered steroids as if it were a treatment comparable to biologics. Kind of like “some people take steroids and some people take biologics but steroids don’t work as well” which is weird because I don’t think anyone really takes steroids in place of biologics longterm.

 Anyways, insurance stuff is taking forever of course and my symptoms are mild but I’m worried about getting worse or having damage happen if it’s gonna take several more months to get on biologics.

773,Rinvoq,New Crohn’s diagnosis,"Hi all. My name’s Ashlee, 36, from the UK. I have recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s after a decade of chronic, severe abdominal pain and every test and scan imaginable (to me at least) and all kinds of attempted treatments tor various different conditions they thought it could be before deciding it is Crohns after seeing something in my small intestine during a colonoscopy. I have several other auto-immune conditions including Addison’s Disease which means treatment by Prednisone is a no-go as it messes up my cortisol levels and can make me very ill. Currently on Upadacitinib (Rinvoq), i’m about 8-9 weeks in and noticed no difference yet, i’m quite keen to be off it and try something else if it isn’t going to work as they have to be very careful in monitoring my white blood cell count while i’m on this as my immune system is already severely suppressed (due to Addison’s and not having a spleen) and this apparently suppressed it more, making infections much more likely. Due to go for another endoscopy and blood test soon and discuss possibly lowering the dose or changing medication. My symptoms have been constant severe abdominal pain a couple inches to the left of and slightly above my belly button that is always there, but on a sliding scale from a 3 on a good day to an 8-9 (with lots of gurgling and squirming noises/sensations in my guts) on a bad day, sulphuric smelling, frequent gas, going to the toilet a lot more and it always being loose, and the inability to tolerate any spicy food any more and had radically changed my tastes and tolerances compared to before the pain started. Have literally gone from eating vindaloo to struggling with mild spices since starting with symptoms. Before my diagnosis, the only thing that ever took away the pain was getting drunk and led to me going off the rails for a while seeking to ease my pain for a few hours every so often as I lost my job after long term sickness with little hope of improvement despite constant investigation by the gastroenterology team, but I now work from home, have a 16 month old son and never get the chance to touch alcohol anymore, and codeine, paracetamol and CBD gummies never did touch the pain so never bother with them😅 Really just looking for any information/suggestions/advice that might help. When i’m really bad, panting and doubled over in pain and unable to face any other food, I find myself drawn to eggs, rice pudding, porridge and dairy. Not sure why, but it actually helps. Any tips for a total newbie would be greatly appreciated😊 I have no idea what i’m doing and would love some guidance from those with more experience. I appreciate you all!

Now, I am dealing with the aftermath, with 3 setons placed and 4 fistulas in total.

My colorectal doctor examined me today and is pleased with how Rinvoq is treating things, but is still adamant that my only options are to continue the meds or opt for a colostomy— He (and other doctors I’ve seen) refuses to relent and perform any type of correctional surgery on the fistulas.

I admit that physically I feel pretty well, but I am still unable to perform day-to-day tasks because it is impossible to get clean after bowel movements without showering or a sitz bath, which makes existing away from home quite a challenge. and if I try, to get clean without those methods that is, I pop a low fever within 24 hours without fail.

So, what was your moment that you decided enough was enough? Was it worth it? Did it improve your quality of life drastically?",2024-05-31 20:08:05,CrohnsDisease,12,1d54vt6,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1d54vt6/what_was_your_hit_a_wall_moment_before_you_got_a/,2024-05-31
787,Rinvoq,Starting Rinvoq,"Hello! 

Background:
Diagnosed while in high school, had 11 naive years of ‘remission’ and currently dealing with a flare from end of Jan 2024. Was put on Entocort which helped, once I got off of it - inflammation symptoms came back. Blood work is bad. 

I got a free 28-day sample of Rinvoq (45mg), started taking it today! (04/24/2024). Will be talking to the Patient Support Program to get on Pharmacare. 

Wondering if anyone can share their experience with Rinvoq? 

Are there side effects I should be concerned about? Signs that I should look out for? 

I’m currently taking quite a few supplements:
Selenium, Curcumin, Milk Thistle, Vitamin B1, CoQ10, Calcium Citrate, Vitamin D, Probiotic. 

As well as a huge dietary shift. Avoiding dairy, gluten, sugars (not including fruit), processed foods, preservatives, additives. 

And I’m going to therapy. Trying to meditate daily as well as doing light stretching. I’ve been able to walk my dog lately ☺️!

Would love to hear your opinions and suggestions. This forum has served as a great community as I’m dealing with this flare. 

Thank you. 


EDIT: 
I’ve hit the 10 day mark on Rinvoq. Acne has begun, and I’m noticing my stools are getting more solid and less frequent. 

BUT! My pain is still here. The sharp abdominal pain, and now it feels like my whole left side is cramping up. (I also have frozen shoulder… again. 3 times in 4 months) 

Is this normal? My GI isn’t returning my calls. 


EDIT!!!!
I have hit the 16 day mark and wow. I feel like this is a miracle drug?? I hope my lab results show the improvement I feel. 

Yes the acne is present, but I’ve just upped my hygiene - washing my face twice a day with good products, got pimple patches. It definitely makes your skin greasy. 

I’m able to eat anything!? I had raw lettuce last night, and was met with a great poop this morning. My pain is minimal, and my energy is up! (Minus when I have a bowl of pasta, I feel asleep sitting…)

9/10 drug. So far so great! 

EDIT:
It’s been 6 weeks since my last update. 

I went away for 4 weeks to Europe, and wow. Rinvoq allowed me to eat anything, and stay active while there. To be fair, the food quality is MUCH better than Canada (and especially USA.) i felt a difference as soon as i got back home. Immediately had more bloating and cramps. 

I did have one issue in Europe, inflamed tonsils. The doctors there were great. I took Penicillin (antibiotic), probiotics, and gargle with diluted hydrogen peroxide and the issue was resolved within a week.

But overall Rinvoq has been great! Getting some acne but mostly around menstruation. Been able to keep it at bay with Cera Ve cleanser + lotion, and pimple patches. 

Going to get a blood test soon to review the effects on my RBC, WBC, C-RP, and iron. ",2024-04-24 18:50:51,CrohnsDisease,9,1cc69io,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1cc69io/starting_rinvoq/,2024-04-24

789,Rinvoq,Switching from Entyvio to Rinvoq,"Hello, first and foremost, thank you for clicking on this thread ☺️

As the title suggests, i’m currently still on entyvio and have been on it for the past two years. The problem with it is that I have to do intervals of steroids and the side effects are getting worse and worse. The longer it takes for entyvio to deteriorate itself, the better it is ofc. However, those periods of sole use of entyvio are getting shorter or weaker with time.
Hence, my doctor has decided to put me on Rinvoq. We will be starting in a month or two, waiting on insurance. He (my doctor) said the results of crohn’s remission to symptoms are through the roof with this med. Even going on to say that all his patients are in remission with it and even the pre entyvio ones are more satisfied. While that is reassuring, i’m extremely worried about the side effects. 

Can anyone who has had experience with Rinvoq or know someone who has tell me more about side effects? May be how it went throughout the treatment, any ups and downs? How fast did it work? How long were you on it for? Any changes you noticed (wether positive or negative)?

790,Rinvoq,Resectioning Surgery Incoming - Any Advice on Sleep?,"Hi fellow Crohnies,

After multiple failed biologics and most recently failing Rinvoq after a 12 month trial, it looks like I'm in for my first reactioning surgery in the fall to remove a solid chunk of my ileum and likely part of the cecum, too.

I'm told this will hopefully be a laparoscopic procedure, with potential for a temporary ileostomy depending on how things look in surgery. I'm mentally ready for the bag, and have appreciated reading so many positive stories about ileostomy from people on this forum.

One of my biggest fears about surgery is actually in regards to sleeping afterwards - I'm a die-hard stomach sleeper, and wondering if this is a no-go during the recovery process. Anyone have any experience or anecdotes about this?

Curious to know others’ experience!

If the med works for you:
How soon did you see improvement?
How long before you were in remission?

If you experience(d) side effects:
What side effects do you have?
How quickly did they start?
Have they gotten better/worse with time?

If the med doesn’t work for you:
What happened? 
How long were you on this before switching off?
What other med(s) have you failed?",2024-03-10 07:19:36,CrohnsDisease,7,1bb4ezb,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1bb4ezb/new_to_rinvoq_a_few_qs/,2024-03-10
796,Rinvoq,First week of rinvoq ,"Obviously tons of threads on this lately. Wanted to share the experience of my first week and also get the experiences of where folks are at in their journey with this med. 

Was in a moderate trending to severe flair. Took my first 45mg dose Monday. Overnight I could tell some changes were happening. (My first dose of Remicade in 1999 did the same). Had some return of appetite Tuesday. Wednesday my stool began a trend toward good. Thursday I ate my first real meal in months, now I was a bit uncomfortable after but no “pain” or bathroom time. Friday my appetite returned fully. Saturday my energy level was fantastic, to the point a co worker commented “you have a glow about you today”. This morning, Sunday I’m having a coffee before going for a short jog.

I haven’t seen blotchy skin or acne yet. I have had a relentless urge to pee which can’t be a coincidence. My sleep pattern has been fine. 

Will say, to get this approved by my insurance has been a real struggle. My doc has gone to bat for me and even rinvoq had been in contact to say they have a program to make sure in need patients get the meds at affordable pricing if insurance declines coverage.

So I just got out of the hospital after a 10 day stay due to a particularly bad flare. I lost over 20 pounds and was in bad shape. Currently I’m taking prednisone and actually feeling pretty great for the first time in months.

So the rundown, they scoped me while I was in the hospital and I obviously had active disease and lots of ulcers. My doctor decided that stelera was definitely not working for me and gave me the option to choose between skyrizi and rinvoq. I chose rinvoq because just taking a pill every day as opposed to infusions and injections sounds amazing. I’m currently waiting on insurance to approve it and then I’ll be starting. I just wanted to know what everyone’s experience taking rinvoq has been?

799,Rinvoq,Rinvoq (Upadacitinib),"Hi everyone, 

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s when I was 15. Shortly after my diagnosis, I started infliximab in which I have been on for the past 8 years. Unfortunately, I’ve recently relapsed and the infliximab is now no longer effective in controlling my disease. My consultant has suggested I start upadacitinib (Rinvoq). I understand it was only recently approved as an IBD treatment, so I don’t expect to get too many who might have experience with it. But, I am apprehensive about starting it, and what the potential side effects are. Infliximab has only ever been the only medication I’ve been on at controlling my disease, so I am worried about starting a new medication, especially one that has only just been approved.

4,Humira,How do you know when to stop,"Hey y'all, quick backstory I'm 20F diagnosed a year ago with Crohns and two years ago with Ankylosing Spondylitis (Originally Non-Radial, Now Endopathic Spondy) 3 years ago I moved to another state to work at an apprenticeship that was very physically demanding. Growing up I was told my pain was due to growing too fast and I was in and out of physical therapy with no real relief. So when I was having pain at my job I pushed and pushed for 5 months until it was too much and I moved home in excruciating pain and was referred to a Rheum. Since then I have tried Humira which didn't help but for the past year I have been on the Skyrizi injection after the loading dose infusions. My question is when do you know you can go back to life? When do you decide it's good enough? Some days my joint pain flares and make it impossible to get out of bed, other days it's my stomach pain, after any amount of activity I have more complications. I'm 10x better than I was on no medicine/Humira but I don't feel confident saying I'd be able to go back to my apprenticeship or something close to it or sit for 8hrs at a desk. So I have the option to push harder for a diff medication but then I restart the process over again which adds to the timeline of getting back to the stuff I love and I just feel like I'm in purgatory waiting for my life to start. I have the best support system in the world but they think we should try to push for even better but at what point is the excess pain just what having a chronic disease is? When I bring that up they get worried Im losing motivation which I know is because it's hard for your loved ones to see you on the sidelines. Still I have motivation obviously lol Anyways thanks for listening to my Ted Talk if anyone has advice or is going through something similar &lt;3",2025-12-03 21:31:16,CrohnsDisease,7,1pdh4zj,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1pdh4zj/how_do_you_know_when_to_stop/,2025-12-03

So, I was on humira,  which was working perfectly. Years later, I got diagnosed with lymphoma hodgkin's,  which, thank god, im in remission for 2 years and a half. 

Since chemo,  been 3 years I've been suffering with stomach pain. Ive tried stelara, didnt work. Now on skirizi, for about a year,  doesn't seem like it's working as I started doing my second re-induction dose (just like when you first start it)

My gastro wants to switch me on Rinvoq,  but considering my past of lymphoma,  im scared      the other option is surgery to remove a fistula. And there's a chance of wearing a temporary bag, which I really dont want. 

Im confused, lost. Dont know what to do. I was thinking maybe of asking my gastro to finish the re-induction doses and see what happens. I didn't seek for a second opinion yet.

And he said not a word about how we’d afford it. Our insurance won’t cover literally anything until we meet our out of pocket max after our deductible, which total between both is $9000. We’re close but it’s also November and we don’t know yet what insurance will look like next year. We can make $550 a month work. His doctor isn’t my favorite, he literally gave my husband no information about his diagnosis. Not if it’s mild, moderate, severe, not where the inflammation is concentrated or anything, not referring him to a dietitian even. However, with our insurance plan, if we want another doctor-they will consider it a second option and that comes with red tape. We can get a new doctor once we move but that won’t be until maybe summer or fall 2026.

14,Humira,Ten years of remission down the drain,"I am a 25F, I was diagnosed with ileocolonic Crohn’s at 14. My last flare was at the age of 15/16 and I’ve been in deep remission since I was 19. I have had a lot of trouble with constipation since due to dismotility.

I was first put on pentasa, then swapped to azathioprine. At 19 I was put on Humira alongside the azathioprine. At 22 I was taken off both and am currently on thioguianine.

Over the past 18 months I’ve been experiencing symptoms again. I reached out to my IBD nurse regarding frequent loose BM’s and after a clinic appointment I was put on cholestyramine to help with Bile Acid Malabsorption. I have been playing around with it for the past year trying to find a dose that works for me but am still having difficulty.

Within the past three months I have been having frequent cramping. It started out a few times a week but now it is every day, multiple times a day. The pain isn’t as bad as my first flare. I have started having loose BM’s multiple times a day now, currently three a day, luckily no blood. I have also had a constant haemorrhoid that refuses to go away despite treatment.

I reached out to my IBD nurse again and was sent to do a calprotectin test which came back with a result of 168. My last test a year ago was at 55. 

My therapeutic levels for my thioguianine is on the lower side at 884. My nurse believes that my cramping is due to constipation but my symptoms say otherwise.

I have a clinic appointment with her in a month’s time but am at a loss for what to do in the meantime. I have buscopan to help with the cramping somewhat. 

I am feeling incredibly stressed, embarrassed and angry in regard to my body currently. I have no one to talk to that can empathise with my situation.

Enbrel worked for a little while, now on Humira that seems to be working pretty well for the psoriatic arthritis, but the crohn's symptoms developed while I was already on Humira, so not working for that. GI suggested that we could try to find something that works for both.

GI suggested either adding Imuran or switching to Skyrizi as some potential choices, rheumatologist also said Rinvoq is another option. Neither endorsed any one option over any other, saying that we can try whichever I'm comfortable with and see if it works for me. Rheumatologist also said that he'd try to contact GI to discuss between themselves, so maybe they will ultimately suggest one in particular.

22,Humira,Waiting for GI appointment,"got diagnosed in 2016. Been on humira, then stelara, then nothing for 2 years because of insurance issues and life getting busy, suffered through several flares getting prednisone from ER to get by. Fast forward to now I finally got financial assistance and have a GI appointment oct 30th, nine days from now. I finished my prednisone taper a couple days ago and my gut is now back to the raw “scooped out” pain feeling, which I’m assuming is only going to get worse til I see GI. What can I do for pain in the meantime? 

Tylenol doesn’t touch it. I have some oxycodone left from kidney stones and ER said to just take that for pain and then come back to ER if it becomes unbearable or I start vomiting/passing blood etc. 

I really do not want to be hospitalized because I need to work, my landlord is nuts (eager to evict us)  and my partner is in between jobs so we’ve been doing delivery to scrape up money for bills, he can’t do deliveries on his own because no license (tied up out of state, PA DMV sucks, working on fixing it) 

So I’m trying to figure out what I can do to bear the pain in the meantime. I’m thinking of getting a car heating pad for when we are working, heat helps a lot but only when it’s on me. I don’t want to be popping oxys like crazy so I’m saving them for if the pain gets bad but not “ER I’m dying” bad. Any advice? :( ",2025-10-21 20:26:38,CrohnsDisease,1,1oco14x,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oco14x/waiting_for_gi_appointment/,2025-10-21
23,Humira,"For those in long term remission from Chrons, what is the biggest surprise you had?","Hello!

Male, 30's from Canada. I have had Chrons since I was 18. On weekly Humira.

When I was initially diagnosed with Chrons, I was very sick. I had lost over 50 lbs, inflammation had spread to my knees and I couldn't walk, and I was in constant pain/cramp/nausea etc. I was diagnosed with Chrons in the ileum.

Early on, I was fortunate enough to find a therapy that worked (Humira) which seems to have put me in remission. I gained back all the weight and my life is basically normal - I eat what I want, do what I want with virtually no pain on a day to day basis. I suppose this is the result of being diagnosed early and managing the inflammation. However, I know my doctor has told me that I still have some scarring/narrowing in that area. But at the same time, I have taken Humira level tests and the doctor believes the treatment is working.

My question is the following: For those of you in long term remission - have you experienced any unpleasant Chrons related surprises later on in your life? Is it possible for the disease to progress even if the disease appears to be under control (sounds like a paradox lol)?

 For example: Is it still possible to develop a serious bowel obstruction even though the Chrons is in remission?

Thanks! :)

PS: Reading posts about people recently getting diagnosed, I realize I am slowly becoming one of the older guys with Chrons. Everyone reading this - please do not lose hope! Things do get better! :)",2025-10-21 13:25:51,CrohnsDisease,18,1occwlk,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1occwlk/for_those_in_long_term_remission_from_chrons_what/,2025-10-21

I’ve been on and off of prednisone for a year now as well because every time I taper off of it, my symptoms return. I have two fistulas as well. I am just feeling so down and sick of feeling this way. I work a full time job and am a mom to a toddler and I do not have the time or energy to be sick.

27,Humira,Need advice on what to do next…,"So I just got new health insurance (sentara health plans). I take Humira but they rejected prior authorization, my doctor came back with a letter of medical necessity which was submitted this past Thursday. 

I called my GI doc to see if there was an update, and they said my insurance legally has 30 days to make a decision. I currently have enough Humira on hand to last me until November 16th, but I will need more again for November 30th which is when I need my next shot. 

My initial plan was to apply for the abbvie patient assistance program if my insurance denied my doctors letter of medical necessity. I’m pretty sure the process for abbvie to make a decision is around 20-30 days. 

So now I’m wondering what to do. It’s seeming like I can wait for my insurance to respond, but if they respond with a no, then I would have to wait for abbvie to approve me for their assistance program, which would then mean I’m late on my meds. 

My insurance offered a biosimilar (simlandi) but I honestly am scared to switch. I’ve only ever been on Humira and I know it works so I really don’t want to switch.

32,Humira,Does any insurance cover name brand Humira anymore??,"I am so sick of dealing with health insurance. Every month when it’s time for a refill it feels like something goes wrong and I am left having to make phone calls for two weeks straight having to manage between my insurance, my pharmacy, and my doctors office because it seems like no one can do their job right. 

My issue now is that I recently got new insurance and they aren’t wanting to cover Humira. I’ve been in Humira since I was diagnosed in 2018 and I really want to stay on it instead of switching to Simlandi because I know it works. I also have a baby and I really don’t have the time to be in and out of the hospital again. 

Before having my baby I had insurance through my employer which was Anthem BCBS and they covered the Humira no problem with a prior authorization. End of 2024 I lost that insurance due to my decrease in hours since having my baby, then ended up on Medicaid. They did cover it at first with a prior authorization but then they randomly decided they didn’t want to cover it anymore and said once the prior authorization ended they wouldn’t cover Humira at all. 

Now I’ve lost Medicaid, so I got insurance through my states insurance marketplace and the only two options I was given were Anthem Healthkeepers and Sentara Health Plans. Neither of which said they would cover Humira. I figured Since Medicaid is Anthem Health keepers Plus that I would run into the same issue if I chose Anthem Healthkeepers, so I want with Sentara Health Plans, plus they had better ratings. I spoke with an insurance agent that said my medication would be covered if I got a PA, so I was hopefully at first. Well they denied that and want my doctor to write a letter of medical necessity now. 

Does any insurance cover Humira anymore?? Do all of them make people switch to generic/biosimilars?? ",2025-10-08 09:51:10,CrohnsDisease,11,1o16521,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1o16521/does_any_insurance_cover_name_brand_humira_anymore/,2025-10-08
35,Humira,I am suffering but my labs are fine,"I dont know what to do in this situation. Have been on TNF-alfa blocker for a long time, started 2010 with Humira. Reason I started was AS diagnosis which caused lots of pain in my hips and legs.

2021 diagnosed with Crohns and switched to Remicade.

Didnt have stomach ache before diagnosis, just uneasy stomach now and then.

But since then I have gotten stomach issues and my troubles with my stomach have been keeping on for 2 years, and I have been on prednisolone once(worked wonders) and budesonide twice (worked fine first time, not so good second time).

Now in addition to stomach pains, tiredness and heartburn, I am also suffering more and more aches in my knees and legs.

My GI seem reluctant to change anything, I swiched to her like 2 years ago and I get the feeling she thinks my medication is doing fine since lab results are fine. But they were fine even at the time of diagnosis, when I had several ulcers in ileum.

Have anyone else been in a similar situation? I get that I am in a way fortunate that the disease is somewhat in control, but at the same time I dont feel I have much quality of life.

Can I ask to try a lower dose of prednisolone? I just feel like I have to do something. I have already gone down in work hours, but I feel like its getting harder and harder to not go down more.

39,Humira,my parents refuse to acknowledge my Crohn’s because of RFK,"Rant. Genuinely I think I’m in the bad place. 26f diagnosed at 22. Started with Humira, failed, on Skyrizi now. My next scope is next week and my new insurance is being an issue and it’s going to cost a LOT more out of pocket than I had originally thought, and my parents (dad in particular) are loaded and used to always say they’d help me with medical bills if it got too high. 

My mom was a labor/delivery nurse in the 90s, and my dad works in security. So for some reason my mom has started to go down this conspiracy rabbit hole about doctors all scheming to make money off of prescribing us medicine, giving vaccines, procedures, etc. I told her I’m scared to death about this scope since I could need surgery, and she went on this rampage about how “the doctors are just pushing this on you to make extra money” and “you’re probably fine, you aren’t having diarrhea every day anymore and don’t need to do all this Crohn’s stuff” 

She is a NURSE. I have a DISEASE. I’m not in remission. I have active inflammation. This is the same mom that fought my first GI for not treating me when I was 22, doubled over in pain, bleeding, losing all my weight. I didn’t realize the whole thing about “doctors make money off of pushing meds on you” was an RFK scam. I’m about to turn to crowdfunding because I can’t afford my medical bills, and now my parents are shaming me for even getting the medical help I need because of the Evil Doctors Scam or whatever the hell rfk is saying.

46,Humira,Currently Flaring/Steroids,"I’m really struggling right now. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2022 after being hospitalized, and I’ve never experienced remission. 
	•	Treatment history:
I started on steroids in the hospital after diagnosis and was basically sent home in adult diapers. I got anemia, even lost my hair. Then I moved to Humira, and later Skyrizi (even tried a dose change), but it didn’t help. Because of yearly insurance changes, it’s a battle to get the biologics each time, I just had a 6 month gap where I was on nothing because I was so tired of it all. 
	•	I finally decided I needed to get things under control.  Insurance just denied Entyvio (well not explicitly but I would need to pay $4600 out of pocket for the infusions) and I can’t afford it. So I asked my doctor about steroids while waiting for the next drug. Just to really improve quality of life. Reflecting back that I have never had remission and how bad I was when I left the hospital on steroids, this doesn’t make sense but my disease was nowhere that severe so I figured it was worth a try. Instead of helping, three days in I had my worst flare since diagnosis. Even after a week, there was no improvement, so I weaned off.
	•	Now:
My doctor started me on cholestyramine, but it hasn’t been much relief—in fact now I have nausea and gas. I’m still having frequent, painful, small-volume bowel movements with straining, and my hemorrhoids are worse than ever. I would say I had a small amount of improvement in ok not going as much but still more than anyone in their right mind would put up with. 
	•	Next step (hopefully):
I’m supposed to be starting Tremfya, but I’m stuck in the insurance approval/shipping black hole. I will be asking for an update tomorrow.

Right now I’m exhausted and desperate for some relief. I have missed a week of work. I am going to try to go to work tomorrow, although I have a feeling I’ll be leaving early. Has anyone else had steroids make things worse instead of better? And while I wait for Tremfya, is there anything else I should be asking my doctor about to help me get through this flare? It honestly feels like my doctor’s office could care less. I know that’s not likely true but I never even see the doctor anymore just the PA and I just don’t think they understand how bad it is even though I said I’m missing work. Fun fact: I’m a veterinarian and my very small practice is old. We have one tiny bathroom for everyone- clients and staff. It’s obviously a Crohn’s nightmare.

49,Humira,I need advice on constant onslaught of new issues,"Hi friends. I have had Crohn’s disease (diagnosed) for 15 years. I am 30 years old, and female. I have been on Humira (now Hyrimoz) for 4 years. I had no side effects whatsoever. I felt amazing! Except coincidentally the same month I started Humira I got horrible acne which has never gone away since. About a year ago I developed psoriasis, and my dermatologist let me know that Humira is probably causing it, but if it’s working for my Crohn’s best not poke the bear so I’ve been treating the psoriasis with 3 different topicals for a year now. Now a few weeks ago I thought I had a UTI. Turns out there’s no bacteria just blood and RBCs in my urine. All my kidney function is fine and an ultrasound confirmed I have no kidney stones but I have a constant urge to pee and a follow up UA is still showing blood and RBCs so I’m likely being referred to urology. 

My GI is adamant none of my other issues, including the psoriasis, have anything to do with my Crohn’s or Humira. My family doctor is lost, I feel like she barely knows what Crohn’s is. I don’t really know where to turn to try and figure this out and see if any of this is connected… maybe I should just switch off Humira?

I've only had the loading dose and one self-injection of stelara but have been flaring massively the past few weeks and my gastroenterologist now wants to know if i want to switch again to rinvoq.

Oh and they've said i'd need a shingles vaccine before going on rinvoq which would cost $700 which I don't have! It feels like such a gamble.

i had a c section in january. the combination of the NSAIDs and antibiotics and postpartum stress (my daughter was stillborn) sent me back into another flare. my calprotectin and WBC were elevated, hemorrhoids and skin tags inflamed, and the full spectrum of digestive symptoms. my skin issues returned, so did my cold sores. but since i was postpartum, i wasn’t able to track weight loss or fatigue because find me a postpartum woman who isn’t fatigued.

i had a colonoscopy a few weeks ago and the crohn’s is gone! after a round of rectal budesonide for six weeks, my calprotectin was down and my symptoms were feeling better. however, my symptoms aren’t gone. they are better, more manageable. but when i’ve had periods of remission in the past, i have been mostly symptom free.

I wrote a post earlier this year about rashes that I think are because of Humira.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/s/XxM5TxoN8k

Now I’ve met with a dermatologist that doesn’t think Humira is the reason - she said that I have perioral dermititis and eczema, and has given me a lot of different creams (that doesn’t help to be honest, although it has only been 1,5 month.) 
My GI was happy about the dermatologist’s opinion, as the medicine works for my gut, and I’ve been tested for antibodies and don’t have any antibodies or other signs of not tolerating the drug.

However, I have never had this bad skin eczema-wise and I feel pretty sure that Humira is the bad guy here.
What would you do? Try another medicine? Or be happy that it works for your gut but eat allergy medication everyday and use different creams and not being able to use makeup just so that you can continue on Humira?

81,Humira,"Ugh, back into the flare zone","After a year of an incredibly successful remission where I felt like I was getting my life back, the last few weeks have slapped me in the face with a flare.

I’m so stressed about it. My previous flare was almost life ending and I’m absolutely terrified of that happening again… at the moment my symptoms aren’t awful but I just can’t really stomach any food. Have hardly eaten today, and that always terrifies me. Here’s to hoping my IBD team get back to me soon and I can get treatment going.

My big fear is Humira isn’t working anymore, but there’s loads of other meds and another one will work, that’s all I can hope for. 

Just trying to remind myself it will pass, and all I can do is ride it out until it’s over. Hope everyone who’s in the same position is doing as ok as we can 🫂

82,Humira,"Newly diagnosed, hi 👋🏻","34F. I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis back in 2014 so I’ve always been aware of the Crohn’s possibility. When I started having bad GI symptoms in April I was like hmmm. I had two high calprotectin tests (230/290), negative tests for any infectious causes, and an endoscopy and colonoscopy that both showed erythema but biopsied normal (though they did find a surprise pre-cancerous polyp, so very grateful for the colonoscopy). 

My GI suspected that it was hiding in my small intestine so we did enterography on Monday. I got the results like 20 minutes later confirming active IBD in the jejunum with no complications. I don’t see my GI until August 14th but I imagine this is definitive. 

I’m on Cosentyx right now for AS which I know will have to change, which is fine since honestly it wasn’t working that great on the AS either. I’m guessing remicade? My rheumatologist had been floating that already. Humira didn’t work on my AS.

I’m not freaking out or anything since I’m used to the autoimmune merry go round. I guess just wondering if there’s anything you wish you’d known when you were first diagnosed? I’ve been researching a lot so I know the basics, so tell me what Google won’t.

83,Humira,"Crohn's at 60, while already on Humira","(Cross-post)

Hey all, my mother has had AS since 2015 (but was only diagnosed in 2018). She's been taking Humira every 2 weeks since then and her axial symptoms were thankfully in control.

Fast forward to 2024 and she begins having loose stools. Doctors blamed it on her gallbladder removal, IBS, etc. But then in June of 2025 she developed partial obstruction of her ileum. AKA she got pretty bad terminal ileitis/Crohn's at 60 years old.

Now we're stumped as to what to do. Her rheumatologist doesn't want to quit Adalimumab since it's working for her back (but obviously not working for her intestines) and yet our GI doctor prefers biologics. Does anyone here receive dual biologics? He said it's risky.

Would ileal resection from the get go be a bad idea?

She took azathioprine for 2 weeks and developed pancreatitis she still hasnt gotten over, so I reallyyy don't want her to take something else like methotrexate. They're so hard on the body and my mother is 60.

Thanks for reading till the end! God bless.

86,Humira,"Not Convinced it's Crohns, and Dr. also doesn't seem so sure..","My stomach pain seems to be directly related to eating things that don't agree with me. Some days I'll feel normal, then one day I eat something like a spicy taco, and I'll feel bad for a couple days. Bowel movements are always like clock work, 8am every morning and usually again after dinner, mostly solid. My calprotectin was only 109 even though it felt like my lower left abdomen really hurt (which is why I saw a GI and demanded a scope). I recently broke my back in a couple places riding dirt bikes and was on a steady diet of Aleve at the max dose for 8 weeks straight leading up to my colonoscopy. They found multiple diffuse aphthae with surrounding erythema at the ileocecal valve and first 10cm of TI. They also found patchy mild erythema in distal sigmoid with a few scattered lesions that appear to be inflammation. The pathologist sent the biopsy to UCLA for further review and the final results stated that there was patchy mildly active ileitis in the ileocecal valve and patchy mildly active colitis with focal paneth cell metaplasia in the distal sigmoid. The final determination is that the results could be related to Crohn's but that the findings were not enough to determine a specific diagnosis of Crohn's and damage from medications needs to be clinically ruled out. 

What are the chances I have IBS and the inflammation was caused by taking a ton of Aleve for 8 weeks straight? The doctor wants to jump right into Humira even though I seem to have a mild case since they keep using the words ""mildly"" and ""patchy"". I am thinking of requesting to try budesonide and then masalamine for 6 months and rescope to see if the inflammation is gone. I just don't want to kick myself in the ass and have it go from mild to severe in 6 months while I try less risky medications than biologics...

91,Humira,Work out / Gym advice needed DESPERATELY,"Hi everyone I need gym advice and i feel like this is the best place to come for it.

I’m a 22 year old female and i’ve had crohns for the past 2 1/2 years. For context I’m 5’6 and growing up i always had a fast metabolism so weight gain wasn’t really an issue with me, i played golf in high school so the gym just wasn’t something i ever did. When i went to college the freshman 15 hit me like a truck i averaged about 120 lbs in highschool and my sophomore year of college right before my crohns manifested i was 135. Once i realized how unhappy i was with my weight gain i started working out and trying to lose weight, but all that meant was walking on the treadmill and stairmaster and just eating less calories. Then my crohns entered my life one random day and i dropped down to 105 lbs in 2 months. for the past two years my weight has fluctuated but always centered around 110. I started Humira 2 months ago and i have already seen a massive improvement, and i’ve gained weight i’m sitting around 116 right now. I didn’t work out the whole time i was unmediated just because i felt so sick i couldn’t. So my question is what should i do to work out, the gym intimidates me a lot and i just never know what to do with all those machines. If someone could give me just a basic guide of what to do in the gym that would make my life way easier.

95,Humira,Just started Humira and need help really bad from people who get me,"Hi everyone, I’m a 20 year old college student who just did my first dose of Humira yesterday after being diagnosed with Crohn’s a few weeks ago. I also have Celiac and ARFID, and have lost a significant amount of weight… which is actually how my gastro came to diagnose me with Crohn’s, because apparently I am severely underweight and this summer have undergone many tests and we have come to this conclusion that I have Crohn’s and apparently UC that my doctor is deciding to treat with Humira. I started yesterday, and since my first dose yesterday I am feeling extremely weak, sometimes I have an alright appetite but yesterday and today I have ABSOLUTELY no appetite, today especially. I am a lover of miso soup, so I suggested that to my dad, but I immediately started sobbing as soon as the words left my mouth and didn’t want it anymore. In fact I don’t want anything. No safe foods. But I am starving and my parents have been pushing me to eat even when I’m not hungry (which I’m obviously not doing… I have no appetite at all) even though I understand that I need to eat and ABSOLUTELY, I promise you, I want to gain this weight back. My gastro and I do not have a good relationship, but because of my family’s coverage, I have no choice but to keep seeing her, I promise we’ve tried to get in with new doctors at other places but no one can accept us. The reason I say my gastro and I aren’t exactly birds of a feather is because, 1, I was very phased by all these tests (CT scan, Barium is the antichrist, just about 5000 blood tests, and endoscopy and colonoscopy), but more so, it’s what she’s been prescribing me. Before starting Humira, she put me on a corticosteroid, I’m sure you all know that song and dance, and her choice steroid for me was Prednisone. You guys. I never understood all the commercials on TV for medicines with the disclaimers of “may cause su!c!dal thoughts and actions” until I took that prednisone. I spent 2 weeks on it, did not move from my bed every day, felt like a shell of myself, if even a shell…. And genuinely was having thoughts that would NEVER organically be in or come from my own brain. I was so depressed and still am. After a week of calling my gastro every day sobbing saying I need to get off the pred, she FINALLY switched me to budesonide. Things were looking up. I spent a good week eating and being able to even go out with my friends again, and living again finally. Welp. I just started the Humira injections yesterday, a starter dose of 2 shots at 180 mg altogether, and I am back to having no appetite. Not even my safe foods. Nothing. I’ll think about a food and it’ll sound good for a second, but then the thought and work of actually going through with it turns it into something completely unappetizing and I just start crying again. I feel like a mess. Not even weed is helping, which has saved my appetite in the past and risen it out of the tomb, but nope, it’s not helping now. I have no idea what to do. I tried reading and lost the motivation. I tried journaling (you guys I normally LOVE writing, if you can’t tell from the way this is already 2k words right here), lost the motivation, dude I can’t even play on my 3DS without losing interest and I have spent this whole summer letting my 3DS take me away and distract me into having some fun again. I can’t even begin to explain the stress and depression I am feeling watching my mom worry about me, she really thinks this is the worst I’ve ever been, I’m not soooo underweight that I can’t come back from this, but I just feel like I don’t know HOW long it’ll take to come back from this. The prednisone incident, and now this Humira — and yeah I get it I’m two days in — but I literally CANNOT afford to lose any more weight, and to be prescribed something that isn’t going to work for me. I also have OCD and the thoughts that I am going to die soon just keep coming. I keep feeling like everything is all for nothing but when I say things like that to my parents they threaten to wheel me away to an asylum because they thinks it’s ME having these thoughts, but I swear I’ve never thought like this before. My OCD hasn’t ever sounded like what it’s sounding like now. I understand how, with Crohn’s, it really is about just finding what works best for you, but I can’t deal with how much I feel like a rat being tested right now. I feel like Algernon and I don’t even have the flowers to show for it, you guys (if you get that reference, you’re who I live for). I just CAN’T explain to you how hopeless this all feels. How hopeless I feel. I get it too that it could be so much worse and I’m really trying to be grateful about that. I’m lucky to even be receiving treatment, especially in the circus of a country I’m in right now. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even exactly know what I’m writing to all of you for, I’m really just hoping someone will have something to say that can change my outlook right now. I feel so not me, I’ve been sick a good amount of my life but I’ve never FELT it like I’m FEELING IT right now. Thank you if you read this. I hope you have a good day, or night.. I hope I didn’t bring any of you down to my level with this. It’s a terrible place to be in, not liking your doctor, but I’m sure some of you will get it and maybe have something to say that can save me someway somehow. Love and peace to you all.

102,Humira,Frustrated :/,"Hello all! This is my first time posting on reddit, which i know makes me sound like a loser!  I was diagnosed in 2004 after being pregnant with my 2nd son and losing weight, had a lot of crohns symnptoms.  First meds I was put on were Asacol for the longest-did not help.  Then I was switched to another I cannot remember that helped better but not great.  2005 i had a small bowel resection at the terminal ileum due to a stricture that they told me was ""just gas"" at my local hospital.... I went to another one in another state as I had moved and they admitted me.  Things had been ok but I always asked if ""this is how my life is going to be?""  The physicians did not really seem to be concerned about my continued abdominal pain and diarrhea-I even had accidents and was so frustrated.  Flash forward to now, I had tried Remicade, Humira and budesonide with no help.  I am on Entyvio now and it works for about 4 of the 6 weeks. Once I approach my infusion date a couple weeks prior I have the same awful symptoms.  The pain is what gets me and urgency with diarrhea.  My labs are always elevated WBC and CRP.  My fecal calprotectin (spelling?) is always within normal limits.  Because of other symptoms with my bloodwork and night sweats, they did a bone marrow biopsy.  The hematologist called me personally saying she had never seen what was in my bone marrow-Non caseating granulomas.  This could be due to crohns or sarcoidosis which has been ruled out for now.  I am concerned that there is inflammation in other organs but I am pretty much told that this is what I have to deal with- the Entyvio is working-my last colonoscopy this year did ""not show signs of active disease"" but there was an ulceration present.  

I know this is a lot to read, just looking to see if anyone else has had similar issues and what other tests can be done to find out why I am always hurting?  I hurt when I eat anything, yet hurt when I am hungry?  I have had a CT Enterography, regular CT, PET scan to look for other areas and sarcoidosis, all the usual crohns tests.

103,Humira,How Long Does it take for Stelara to work? Vs How Long Does it generally take for Humira biosimilar to work?,"So as the title says. I have been a chrons disease patient for the past 15 years. Initially I was on Azathioprine, Mesalamine and Hydrocortisone 40mg (Maintenance dosage) for almost 10 years before they finally decided to start biologics on me. I was actually doing alright with those medications before they started biologics. 

So last year, my GI wanted me to try Adalimumab to completely taper off steroids if possible and also Azathioprine since Aza was causing my hemoglobin to go down over the years and as a result I had to take blood transfusions as well.

I started Adalimumab (a biosimilar, not humira). I used it for 7 months approximately. During those 7 months, I was doing fine without Aza (Hydrocortisone was still being tapered slowly and I managed to reach 30mg). But after the 7th month, I got a pretty bad flare. They did a colonscopy and told that I still had ulcers in my ileaum but the disease activity is not that high. However the pain was still terrible. So they switched me to Pred 25mg (yet to taper) and the doc suggested to switch to Stelara and use it every 4 weeks instead of 8. So currently I had one loading dose done, and 2 x 90mg self injections are done (total 3 doses have been done). Its been 3 months since this flare and Stelara (Around 9 weeks but 3 doses are done) I still don't see much improvement since if I taper Pred, I am getting bad pain again.

So my questions are:

1. Should I give more time to Stelara for it to kick in? My GI was like since you are taking it every 4 weeks and I have taken 3 doses already. Let's wait for 1 or 2 more doses before we think of next treatment. Do you think that's too quick to make a call and realistically I should give 6 months-1 year?

2. Also, do you think I shouldn't have switched from Adalimumab to Stelara? Considering Adalimumb worked for 7 months properly before getting a flare? Do you think that was a quick switch? And rather I should have continued to use it? My GI dint even try weekly dosage before switching me off to Stelara.

So yeah, all this treatment is confusing me. My only options are Stelara and Humira biosimilar btw from where I am located. I can't take infliximab infusions every month due to the nature of my work. And all other new biologics are not currently available in my country.",2025-07-01 07:22:57,CrohnsDisease,3,1love8k,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1love8k/how_long_does_it_take_for_stelara_to_work_vs_how/,2025-07-01

Hi all, I (22F) was diagnosed with Crohn’s at 15. I initially took Humira but the government where I live took the medication off of the special support program and was no longer covered for it. Then, I switched to Simlandi. Something happened with that medication as well and I fell out of remission. I’ve been taking Abrilada once weekly since that situation. I was doing well for awhile, but started to feel sick in November of last year. I was told that I was taking too many vitamins and that’s why I felt shitty. My GI doctor finally ran some tests. My fecal calprotectin level is 1,140. I feel so weak and I’m having a hard time functioning in my day to day life. I haven’t heard anything from my doctor yet. I’m at a loss for what I should do at this point. I’m so sick of repeatedly falling out of remission and transferring to different meds only to have it not work. Is there a specific medication I should try to advocate for? What has been working for everyone? I’ll take ANY advice I can get regarding what next steps need to be taken.

108,Humira,British Society of Gastroenterology new guidelines on IBD,"I was diagnosed with Crohn's last year and was working through a severe flare most of that time, with my only relief being a few rounds of prednisone. I'm finally seeing more relief now after a bowel resection and ileostomy.

But throughout the past year, I've spent a lot of time on this subreddit and I've noticed trends of posts about people trying to figure out what to do, struggling with mental health, or trying to get a diagnosis.

The British Society of Gastroenterology published new guidelines on IBD and I felt like some of the takeaways could be really helpful (and were some things I would love to go back a year and share with myself), so I wanted to share. Specifically, 3 things that felt like they could be impactful for helping us work with our care teams:

1. Biologics earlier: If your Crohn's looks aggressive, doctors might now recommend starting with biologics right away and not wait to ""fail"" other meds. This feels huge. I spent the better part of the last year suffering in a severe flare while I worked through budesonide (failed) -&gt; prednisone (helped so much for limited times) -&gt; Humira (failed) -&gt; Rinvoq (failed). Ultimately ended up getting the bowel resection before I got a chance to move on to Tremfya (which I'm starting in a few weeks).

2. Track often: The new standard is full remission, not just feeling okay. That means regular tracking of things like bloodwork, calprotectin, and CRP to guide treatment. I love the idea of the guidelines being more proactive here with regular tracking. Also, for those of you asking ""do I have Crohn's"", an ileocolonoscopy is still noted as the gold standard for diagnosis. And fecal calprotectin is recommended as the first go-to test. Both are great to ask your doctor about if it hasn't been a discussion yet!

3. Mental health is part of care: Fatigue, stress, diet, and emotional health are finally being taken seriously and support should be part of your treatment plan. As we all know, Crohn's takes such a huge toll. I see so many posts here with people just looking for support and connection. I'm lucky enough to have been in therapy for the past couple years, but I definitely felt like Crohn's and my lifestyle changes became a big topic over the past year.

110,Humira,Rinvoq too soon?,"Hi there. A short background about me so I can hopefully gain some insight from here!

I've had Crohn's since I was 8 (now 34).

Over 30 surgeries.

Permanent ileostomy.

Allergic to remicade. Did well on Humira roughly 15 years ago.

The past 2 years I was on NO medication whatsoever for my Crohn's. I was doing pretty well until about 3 weeks ago I had a horrible flare and had to go to ER (extreme abdominal pain, nausea, no output from  bag, and dehydrated). My blood markers were seemingly ok despite all of this- inflammation marker a tad high. They did a CT and it showed inflammation. They put me on prednisone ( I hate this drug so much). It's been keeping me at bay, but I'm noticing my stomach cramps coming back somewhat.

I went to a new Gastro that's closer to me than my current one (she's 7 hrs away and can't see me until December) He immediately wants to put me on Rinvoq. Even after I told him I had been ok for 2 years. He did blood work. But he's not going to do any other scans or tests. other than scoping me in July. After reading so many horror stories about this drug, I am absolutely terrified. So I'm wanting to wait to take Rinvoq until afterward to see what is shown with the ileoscopy.

He says Rinvoq is the best med out right now for Crohn's. But I'm very worried that this medication could almost make me worse, if that makes sense? And why not try me back on a biologic? Perhaps, I need a 2nd opinion from another gastro? 

Any blessings, thoughts, or advice are welcome!!",2025-06-22 20:36:13,CrohnsDisease,2,1lhxymc,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lhxymc/rinvoq_too_soon/,2025-06-22
111,Humira,having a hard time with finding treatment that works,"I have had Crohn's for almost 8 years now. I have lost more weight and gained. I have tried several options of meds, from Humira to Stelara injections, but nothing has worked. I'm in pain almost daily. I work, and that helps keep my mind off of it since I'm up and moving. My doctors are talking about redoing my bowel resection (in my opinion, not great, but I'll do anything.. I have had countless CT scans, MRIs, and blood work. Good news comes in once in a while. For starters, I'm no longer animic.  I haven't needed a blood transfusion in 4 years. i have tried everything im serisoly losing the will to fight and just say screw it. i also havnt found a diet that works for me im nearly at hopeless.

The loading dose after failing humira multiple time (different dosing patterns and tests along side a lot of problems getting the medicine and stuff). All I got were the negative side effects (even the rare ones and the super rare).

I hope this works as I have been on high prednisone for a VERY long time that I need more than a year to tapper it off. (Severe crohn) All to get the tests done and get the medicine approved and being able to get it.

114,Humira,Mild Crohn’s biologics ?,"Quick question. I had a colonoscopy a few months ago that found 3 small superficial ulcers in the ileum. Biopsies showed no sign of Crohn’s, and the MRI was also clear. My gastro prescribed a trial of budesonide to see if I’d respond — all other tests were negative for other diseases.

At first, all symptoms disappeared (mucus, blood, irregular stools), but as soon as I lowered the dose, they came back. She then said it was likely Crohn’s and started me on another 5-month round of budesonide. If that fails, she wants to move to biologics (biweekly self-injections).

It’s been 2 months, and I just had a flare-up with a lot of mucus and some blood — right in the middle of a music festival where I was working for 😭

I have a follow-up next week and might start biologics. But I’m still unsure: biopsies were clean, MRI was clear, and my calprotectin is always low (she said for 1–2% of people it’s not a reliable marker). So how can a disease that shows such little inflammation need such strong meds?

Any thoughts please 🥺

UPDATE : I just started Humira today after being allergic to Pentasa. Can’t wait to see how it goes but I have strong hopes! Thank you everyone 🙏🏻 ",2025-06-19 08:25:55,CrohnsDisease,17,1lf5ksh,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lf5ksh/mild_crohns_biologics/,2025-06-19
118,Humira,Why isn't IBD care more personalized yet? I wish someone would just build something that caters to me lol,"Hi fellow IBD'ers. I’ve had Crohn’s since I was a kid (age 9). Beyond medication (currently on Humira + methotrexate), I’ve tried elimination diets, journaling, apps that want me to track every bite, and countless other things. Some helped a little, but most just added more work without much clarity. What still blows my mind is how random it feels. One week I’m fine with fried chicken or a glass of wine, the next week they wreck me. Same with sleep, stress, activity levels, etc. No consistent rules.

AI can now pass the bar, write your best man speech, plan a vacation. But we still don’t have tools that connect how we eat, feel, and live in a way that actually helps people with IBD make better decisions.

I’d really love to talk with others who’ve felt this same frustration. Are any other people interested on whether we can harness AI to understand our symptoms a bit better?",2025-06-16 11:26:10,CrohnsDisease,15,1lcqays,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lcqays/why_isnt_ibd_care_more_personalized_yet_i_wish/,2025-06-16
120,Humira,I just want one day without a flare up...,"I've had this disease diagnosed at 24, however, they speculated I had it as a kid when I had my first stomach surgery around 7. Stupid kids do stupid things and one day after I got home from school I played with my lunch money and decided what if I could eat one? 🤔 I thought it was cool and told my mom....which wasn't 😅. Went through a Rollercoaster of doctors who thought I could live with it to getting a 2nd opinion and getting 4 inches of my small intestine and appendix. I seemed fine for the most part as a child afterwards but still had stomach pain on and off as I got older to the point that I had a blockage one day and ended up needed 8 inches of my small intestine and a portion of my ileum removed. Ever since that surgery however I've struggled to be okay. I work my ass off and I'm sick everyday doing it at some point with a flare. Mornings are the worst and it doesn't matter what time I wake up I always have a flare and at times it makes me late for work which they understand but it's still embarrassing. I tried Humira and Stelara in the past but both actually made me much worse with 0 immune system. My gi now is the first one to actually say the mind and stomach are connected which I've always believed. I've been way better with my mental, have a good job I love, and a good supportive bf and system, I just can't seem to eat anything anymore without feeling sick 😢. I also have to change my insurance now bc my gi providers changed ugh..I just really could use some advice. I won't lie my mind does get to me with this disease. I'm 32 now and really wanted to have some kiddos by now. But I feel like I'm forever doomed 😓 kinda feel defeated.

123,Humira,Tremfya 6MP combo,"Title says it all. I have really stubborn Crohn’s…. I have taken Humira  (worked for a year), Entivyo (worked for 2 years), Stelara (never worked and developed a bowel obstruction) Remicade ( worked for a year) Rinvoq (never worked), Cimzia ( worked for 8 months), and now I’m on Tremfya.

I have been on and off 6MP. My doc usually pairs it with a TNF blocker but we are trying it with Tremfya. It sucks though because I have to take allopurinol with the 6MP because if I don’t the 6MP messes with my liver enzymes, so I have to take combo allopurinol with 6MP to be able to stay on 6MP. I will say it seems to be working…. The fatigue is extreme but it always is when I take the 6MP, but my Crohn’s symptoms have diminished so much, that I’m down to only 10mg prednisone!!!

I'm happy again, I can enjoy life as i should, i can eat relatively anything!! No where near as much stress.

126,Humira,"6 years without a treatment that has worked for me, I'm scared that I'll go through every treatment without one working.","I'm a 19 year old boy and I was diagnosed with a quite aggressive form of Crohn's disease in 2019 when I was 12 years old. No treatment that I have tried has given me proper success yet, and they almost all seem to come with a very bad cost. 

I first got a  Modulen only diet for 2 months which was quite traumatic.
I tried Methotrexate (both oral and injections) for a few months to a year and it gave me horrible unstoppable nausea when I took it to the point where I developped an irationnal fear of the color yellow at the time (the color of the treatment). 
I then tried Humira for a few years, it calmed the symptoms, but it never brought down my inflammation enough. 
I was then put on Stelara which just did not work, so I switched to Rinvoq. 
Rinvoq gave me extreme and horrible acne to the point my face bled if I touched it. Rinvoq also didn't work and I got a micro-perforation which landed me in the hospital for 3 weeks and kinda scarred me mentally. 

Since then, I'm very scared of having to go back to the hospital, and I'm scared to get a stoma, because where I live, the waiting times to get a stoma out are 3 to 4 years. I was then put on Renflexis (Remicade) which I had an anaphylactic shock too. 

So now I'm on Skyrizi, but I'm scared. My stomach has been hurting a lot from an ilness I contracted recently I think, but every time it hurts too long, I'm scared of having to go back to the hospital.

I'm scared of my disease sabotaging my next semester of college. 
I'm to get a job because I don't know how I could endure it with my disease. 
I'm scared of when I'll eventually have to move out and live alone with my disease in maybe another city.
I'm scared of running out of treatments for me, or running out of time.

I need support please, I feel like I have lived too much of this too young without seeing any progress.

Thank you for reading

128,Humira,First surgery: how did you know it was time?,"I’m facing a push for surgery and worried that it’s going to set off a chain reaction that negatively impacts my life. 

Doctor says I should get surgery, but I feel fine. I’m worried about agreeing to surgery because bowel resections are a slippery slope. I know many people don’t have a choice due to emergency blockages or situations, so I’m hoping to hear from people who actively chose surgery before it chose you. How did you know it was time? 

What makes this decision hard is that aside from a few aches and pains and slightly more frequent bathroom trips than the average person, Crohn’s doesn’t dramatically affect my life right now. I’ve been flaring for 3 years and haven’t had a successful colonoscopy in 2 years, which does worry me a little bit (no cancer detection). I have stricturing (10 cm) and appendicitis, but it’s still within the “okay” range with low chance of obstruction. 

Surgery sounds scary, like it maybe COULD deeply affect my life. It’s been on the table for 2 years, but I keep putting it off in hopes something will work. Unfortunately, nothing has. I’ve been on biologics for over 10 years. Started Remicade (developed antibodies), then Humira (antibodies), quit meds for 3 years, then started my current flare and went on Entyvio, then Stelara, and currently Skyrizi. My labs show little to no inflammation markers but my scans and appendix tell another story. 

I’m just scared to upset this delicate balance of what feels like moderate Crohn’s and tip it into severe with a surgery. How did you feel about your first Crohn’s surgery? How did it turn out for you? ",2025-06-07 20:55:00,CrohnsDisease,16,1l5uylp,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l5uylp/first_surgery_how_did_you_know_it_was_time/,2025-06-07
129,Humira,help,"I was recently diagnosed with Crohn’s over a month ago. It’s been a rough month. Many days of pain, cramping, waking up at night in pain, and skipping work. I’m currently on my 2nd dose of adalimumbab (Humira) and phasing out of a steroid. I take dicyclomine for pain, but it doesn’t do much. My symptoms are bloating, cramping, and constipation. (I was in the hospital initially for an almost blockage, had an NG tube, yuck.) Sometimes it hurts really bad. I’ve been just eating whatever for the past 4 weeks, and then just about everything would set me off. I’ve been on a “bland diet” for a past couple of days but still feel crampy and hurt a lot. I’ve lost 8 pounds already and it feels like I can’t meet the calories my body needs every day. The adalimumbab said it would take 4 to 8 weeks to work (assuming it does) I am on week 3. Any tips on managing a flare up like this/how to get out of it? What can I do to get rid of the constant pain? Tips for making calorie goals to avoid weight loss?

130,Humira,This doesn’t feel sustainable,"Making this post out of frustration since my wife and family and friends don’t understand the frustration of this disease (through no fault of their own). I was diagnosed around 15, I’m 39 now. I was on Humira for about 12 years and it worked great until it ran its course. 

By 33 I needed my first resection of the small bowel. Went fine or so I thought, felt better. Got on stelara after the surgery and 6 months later ended up with a perforated colon and an ileostomy. Stelara didn’t work…

Changed doctors, reversed the ileostomy and was so excited to be on the road to remission. Started skyrizi and while I thought it was working my labs said otherwise, and a colonoscopy confirmed it wasn’t working. 

Started Rinvoq this year, and had a hernia surgery somewhere in there to repair an incisional hernia. After 6 months I think it’s working! Down to 2 bowel movements a day on good days! Then blood, lots of it. Had a colonoscopy 2 days ago and the good news is it’s working, bad news is I have ulcerations near the first resection site. Another surgery…so that’s 5 surgeries in 4 years, haven’t sniffed remission since I was 27. 

Sorry for the long post, lately I’m just wondering if I’ll even make it to 55. Call it the pity party phase. This sucks. ",2025-06-05 02:19:27,CrohnsDisease,94,1l3nwx1,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l3nwx1/this_doesnt_feel_sustainable/,2025-06-05

I had a resection back in like 2018. But a year after it was back and I was back on Humira. My body got used to that then we switched to Skyrizi last summer. I’m actually on every 6 weeks because the 8 wasn’t really working. But here’s where the trouble starts. My doctors office has had issues getting the prior authorizations approved and completed in a timely manner which cause me to miss doses, which led to flare ups. 
To all of y’all out there, what meds are you taking and are they working? I’m not fully on board with Skyrizi being I haven’t been 6-months in remission. 
Then, if you’ve switched doctors; what helped you find a good doctor and how hard was it to find one?

136,Humira,Struggling with Weight,"Hi! I'm 22F, and I was diagnosed with Crohn's when I was 17. Before my diagnosis, I was a relatively skinny teen, and was involved in athletics. I've been on antidepressants (Sertraline) since I was 15, but I didn't struggle with my weight until after my diagnosis, and started Humira. I noticed I've been gaining more and more weight, and it's been a big insecurity. I'm currently around 175, and while my height-to-weight ratio is normal and I'm not unhealthy, I feel really insecure. I know I could probably cut down on my sugar intake, and SSRIs do cause weight gain, but I am an active person, and I eat healthily. I also feel a huge amount of impostor syndrome, since I know that Crohn's usually causes weight loss, not gain, so despite the severity of my symptoms, I don't 'look sick'. 

I know I'm probably being ridiculous, but I wanted to know if anyone else struggles to lose weight and maintain the loss? Is there anything that worked for you? And should I talk to my gastro?

Just had a colonoscopy last week and there is quite a bit of inflammation in my lower gut. Doc recommended blood tests to check Humira levels, and then meet after to make decision. I also just did a calpretectin test and I'm up at 1140 (!!). In addition to all that, there are some other life changes that are forcing me to be out the house more and be more active. 

And I feel like shit. Constant pain/discomfort on my left side, constantly tired, constantly on the toilet (I'm actually writing this from the toilet). I can't focus on work, can barely help my kids or my wife with stuff they need, feeling pretty useless.

Now the Humira blood test takes a long time for results, they guaranteed results back on 23 of June. I booked with my Gastro for the 30th of June. It's possible the results come back before that and if that happens I'll try to get an earlier appointment, but that's just an if.

WHY!?!?!?!? anyways, I’m currently on Cimzia, and after 6 months of remission, I’m flaring pretty hard and I’m back on 40mg of prednisone. I have failed both Stelara and Rinvoq, they just never ended up working. As far as I know now, I have 3 options, Skyrizi, Tremfya, and Omvoh. My question is, won’t it be pointless to try Skyrizi since Stelara targets the same inflammatory pathway, and it never worked for me.

Slower to become “full blown”? No different at all?

160,Humira,How do I stay positive?,"I started showing symptoms of Crohn’s in 7th grade. It started with the constant fatigue and brain fog and then the morning nausea would hit and I would be throwing up and pooping for the first 3 hours of my day. It started getting worse I couldn’t eat or drink anything without having intense debilitating cramping in my stomach that would make me vomit everything immediately. I ended up needing to get my gullbladder out as it was only functioning at 9percent. By this time I had already lost 40 pounds. Go to 8th grade everytime I used the bathroom or even sometimes when I’d walk I would get sharp stabbing excruciating pain in my anus. Often times I would call my mom to pick me up from school when I had to use the bathroom. I was too embarrassed to be caught screaming or crying from the pain in the public school bathroom stall (middle schoolers are mean) and I also had a whole 20 minute prep situation I had to do involving suppositories. The next year I was in intense pain 24/7 and I often thought death would be a better option than the physical pain I was having to endure.  I ended up being referred to a GI surgeon that found 4 fissures. I got a sphincterotomy and BAM instant pain relief when walking and using the bathroom. But unfortunately my stomach cramping and intense vomiting did not subside. I rapidly lost weight till I was only 83 pounds. Fast forward a really expensive GI doctor I got referred to FINALLY diagnosed me with Crohn’s. I got put on Humira and had been in remission until this most recent December when I went into a flare up. 

Long story short I’m going through all of that. Everything. All over again. I’m 22 now and I’m starting to wonder if I will be in pain for most of my life. I’m having a really hard time reconciling that there is no cure. I feel very hopeless it’s hard to stay positive about life when most of the time you can’t leave your couch because your body won’t work the way it’s supposed to and you hurt so bad ALL THE TIME.

Among other concerns like will the new injector cause more pain than my current one or more of a reaction, etc.

It appears this is happening to a lot of people over the past year or so, so I'm obviously not alone.

180,Humira,Dr. says my pain isn’t from crohn’s…,"I was diagnosed with mild crohns in late October of last year after colonoscopy/biopsy. I had deep ulcers in my terminal ileum, dark blood loss, and pain. Normal blood work, normal CRP. No calpro test ordered. Doctor said he didn’t believe my bleeding was from crohns. I was put on humira right after and told we will follow up in a few months to monitor symptoms. I just had my follow up and explained I was still feeling the same type of pain but in less frequency and severity. He tells me he doesn’t believe that pain is crohns related. He says it’s because I have weak abdominal muscles and told me he doesn’t prescribed me Pilates.

So to him I had normal bloodwork while I had deep ulcers in my small intestine, blood not related, pain not related. What is crohns even doing to me then? Should I seek another opinion? 

I’m already on humira so I expected him to say it will take a few more months for the drug to become more effective but instead my pain was told it’s because I have a weak core. Often I’ll get this pain after a bowel movement (sharp pain right side followed by cramping sensation all around belly button that makes it very uncomfortable to stand up straight).

Oh and this all went from a normal tooth ache that needs a root canal to an ER/admission situation the day after I gave my cyltezo (humira). Prior to injection day, I told the dentist and Endosontist I was on it and no one said to ask GI if I should postpone. They said it wasn’t an infection, it was just inflamed.

196,Humira,Is surgery the only option now after some failed medications?,"Hey everyone, just wanted to ask a quick question about bowel resection surgery. I have failed remicade and humira so far, they did seem to help, but I had a lot of emotional stress while on them dealing with my marriage failing and trying to reconcile with my wife. That did not happen and now we're getting a divorce so the emotional stress in my life has lessened quite a but and we have tried to stay on good terms as much ad you can. Anyway, after my last colonoscopy in November my GI said the humira wasn't working because I still had a lot of inflammation in my colon. So I got on Rinvoq around December of last year and have been on 45 mg since. I have improved from about 10 BMs a day down to 4-5 with less cramping. Still have blood and mucus but that seems less as well. Definitely not in remission at all. I can still go to work and some days I do feel pretty good despite the 2 setons I have from fistulas I got over a year ago. Anyway, should I ask my GI if I can start a new medication since I just don't see Rinvoq working for me at this time. They wanted me on 8 more weeks of 45 mg until possibly talking about other options, but I just feel like I need something else. The GI's Physician Assistance mentioned talking to a surgeon about a month ago when I told her my symptoms were still the way they are, but my GI has almost avoided the subject and said she believes I will find a medication that will finally work for me. Is the PA jumping the gun here or does surgery just have to happen now that 3 medications have failed to get me into remission? I'm partially losing my mind getting angry that my body is so resistant to healing itself, even with the help of lifestyle changes and medication. Anyway, I'm still functional, I just don't want surgery unless it's absolutely necessary and I understand my chances of avoiding it my whole life is slim, but the more research that is done and new medications being approved by the FDA I don't want to have life altering surgery unless I'm constantly getting infections or in and out of the hospital. That is not my life currently. Any advice or insight would be appreciated.

204,Stelara,Elective surgery on Monday. Keep second-guessing myself.,"I'm one of those extremely lucky Crohn's patients with very few symptoms.  Besides mild constipation, I was diagnosed because I kept getting severe stomach pains (that I now know were partial intestinal blockages) and eventually ended up in the ER with a full intestinal blockage and a calpro of 4,870.  Whew!

After 12 months of taking Stelara, my next colonoscopy was perfect.  Zero inflammation.  However, I have a stricture so severe that they cannot get into my terminal ileum.  And so the only time I have any issues are, in the week before my injection, I will sometimes get a very minor flare of stricture pain if I eat foods like corn, popcorn, fatty meat, or other things that don't pass as easily through the intestines.

Despite being well-managed with biologics, I am choosing to have a robotic resection to remove the stricture.

See, I like to go backpacking.  Before I was diagnosed, I took a bush plane into Wrangell-St.Elias National Park in Alaska to backpack, and I ended up having a truly distressing night of puking and pain with a partial obstruction (although I didn't know it was that at the time).  I was many, many hours away from a hospital.  So all I can think about is - what if I go to Argentina, or Peru, or Nepal, or Tanzania (all places I have hiked through, or plan to in the next 10 years) and I have to get emergency surgery there?  According to my gastro, chances are high I will *eventually* have to have surgery to remove this stricture at some point in my life...isn't it better to do it when I'm younger and healthy, and can select my own surgeon?  But of course, surgery techniques could be so much better in the future.  A trade-off for sure.

But I know there are always risks, and so I keep second-guessing myself because 99% of the folks here who get surgery are doing it because nothing else is working.  I've read so many posts of people talking about how they'd never do surgery unless it was a last resort, and others who had 6 - 9 months of terrible recovery, and still others who said it was life-changing for the better and they wish they'd done it sooner.

I don't know what kind of responses I want.  Maybe I just wanted to put this out in the world and ask for well-wishes!

So a little over four years. I probably inherited it from my mother, who had a very severe course of the disease. Just like in her case, most medications did not work for me in the beginning.

At 16 I was already on prednisone. At 17 I was put on Stelara but my body never reached any therapeutic level. Remicade did nothing. Methotrexate did nothing.

I am currently on Rinvoq. At first it helped a lot. My inflammation markers even dropped close to zero. But after a stressful period earlier this year I slipped back into active inflammation. Even after reducing the stress and changing my routine, the inflammation has stayed active the entire year. Since January it has never fully calmed down.

Since then a lot of emotional and physical symptoms started that I never have when I am in partial remission. I am usually mentally very stable, but right now I deal with emotional swings, low drive, low libido, erectile problems, unstable energy and a general feeling that I am not myself.

I recently got my testosterone checked. It came back at 6.2. The range I was given was 2 to 8, so they told me it is “normal”. But men my age usually have much higher values, close to around 20. I try to do everything naturally. I lift weights about 3 times a week, even though I often have no strength during active inflammation. When I am in remission I never feel this weak. I manage stress well. I eat healthy food, including beetroot and ginger. I tried supplements in the past but they irritated my Crohn’s.

I am 5’8. My father is 6’0. My brother is 6’2. My cousins are around 6’1. I sometimes wonder if the constant inflammation during puberty slowed down my development. And honestly, I also wonder whether my testosterone was already very low during those years when my body should have been developing the most.

Because of that, I have started thinking about testosterone replacement. I feel like it might help me mentally and physically, especially since I am still young and my body is not fully “finished” yet. Part of me believes that correcting a possibly long lasting deficiency could improve my symptoms and give me more stability. But I am unsure if that is the right way to go.

This is why I am posting here:

Has anyone with Crohn’s been in a situation like this? Has anyone had low testosterone during flares or long active phases? Has anyone tried TRT with Crohn’s, and did it help or make things worse? Do you think TRT makes sense in a case like mine, or is it risky?",2025-11-21 10:57:40,CrohnsDisease,1,1p2vo3h,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1p2vo3h/20_years_old_with_crohns_stuck_in_a_long_flare/,2025-11-21
206,Stelara,Anyone Have Crohn's and Take Amlodipine?,"The Stelara had been working and my last CT scan showed remission about three months ago. I have found conflicting information on Amlodipine, some suggesting it helps inflammation and some saying it makes it worse. 

Two days after starting this medication, I'm in the middle of a bad flare. I fast for three days and everything goes back to normal. About three days later, I'm back to having some of the worst pain, even worse than before surgery. I wanted to go to the ER but physically couldn't go and didn't want to take an ambulance. I've reached out to my doctor but haven't heard back yet.

207,Stelara,Prescriptions while travelling,"Hi everyone, I have recently been diagnosed with Crohns and am just about to start a big overseas trip through Europe. I've been dealing with symptoms for years and am not worried about them, I've travelled plenty before.

I'm on Stelara and have had my infusion, and am due for my first self injection before I leave. For future ones, I either need to take some with me or source it over there. Taking it with me feels like a hassle because I will need to keep it cold. 

What are my options for getting Stelara whole overseas? 
1. Can I get prescribed it over there? I have family in the UK and The Netherlands. 
2. How much will it cost? 
3. Will a working holiday visa help me reduce any cost of getting the drug?

210,Stelara,Positive Story,"Hi everyone, I am a 35 y.o. Male who was diagnosed at age 10/11 with Crohns. I’ve had a bowel resection (2023) and take Stelara.

I wanted to share a positive story. Recently I returned from a dream trip. My wife and I went to Nepal and did a 12 day trek. It’s always been one of my goals but because of the food situation, altitude and physical demands it scared me. But this year we prepped with working out and planning the trip and I was able to enjoy the trip with minimal issues. We hiked for 12 days for 7 hours each day on average, stayed in local tea houses and I even ate mostly Nepali food. 

Hiking has always been my favourite activities because it lets me plan trips to see different parts of the world and also it’s usually mostly outside so as long as I have toilet paper and my poop shovel I feel like I have relative freedom from worrying about washroom access. Thankfully this trip the shovel wasn’t needed. The trekking Nepal is actually fairly Crohns friendly because typically you take breaks every couple hours and often walk through small villages which are used to tourists and have bathroom access (although often it is with a squat type toilet).

Just thought I’d share with the community as I often use it as a resource when I’m down or having health issues. ",2025-11-11 17:39:10,CrohnsDisease,12,1oufwf2,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oufwf2/positive_story/,2025-11-11

215,Stelara,Yesintek copay card,"Is anyone here on yesintek? I was switched from stelara. If so how does their copay program work?

Which means that I need to first buy the medication(approx. $240 after insurance) then I take the order information, the prescription tag on the medication and send that to them for a check. Just seems like a lot of hoops to jump through versus what I had to do with stelara where I just gave them the copay account information. Just trying to make sure I’m doing this right.


Edit: the site I was referring to is enrollyes.com, I was looking at another post and it appears that there is another site on yesintek.com way to get the copay card. I guess Enrollyes.com is only for transition costs between stelara and yesintek.

216,Stelara,Feeling down and would greatly appriciate some encouragement 👏🏼,"Hey there 🧘🏽

I‘ve been going through some rough years … lost my job bc. of IBD … moved to be closer to my family again … a lot of ups and downs

My biggest problem is that while having rather “mild“ symptoms (if diarrhea more soft diarrhea than watery/almost no blood rather mucous/cramps bad but not horrible), my biggest problem is my dwindling amount of safe foods. For a long while now I‘m of the firm believe that my microbiom has horrible diversity (namely none) but the last probiotics I took only ever backfired.

I moved closer to my family and had okay-ish months this year after going through a course of Xifaxan in december (one-sided diet but less bloating a.s.o.) but then my G.I. proposed biologics after Predni and all that didn’t work and then Infliximab and Entiviyo both only gave me side effects (increased bloating/eczema outbreak/eye infection a.s.o.).  
My first (and last) Entiviyo infusion now lies over 6 weeks back and the initial full-body itch that gave me thankfully subsided but I still have big patches of sudden psoriasis and now I get extremely bloated from my usually safe self-baked spelt bread (passing gas a lot/painful large intestines).

I‘m so sick and tired of it all and next week I‘ll hopefully speak to my G.I. again to plan the next step (should gave been a final testing of Stelara but after all those Entiviyo side effects I really believe that lowering my immune system was a shit idea).

Seems like no matter what I do, it always backfires 🥺 Is there hope? Please tell me there‘s hope! I only had white rice and spelt bread for carbs and I can‘t lose bread also 😭 I already only eat out of obligation (3 years of 6 foods and counting).",2025-10-23 20:43:54,CrohnsDisease,4,1oeempt,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oeempt/feeling_down_and_would_greatly_appriciate_some/,2025-10-23
221,Stelara,Need advice-Tapering,"I’ve been up and down on prednisone since mid-August and had to restart my taper all the way back up to 40mg because my symptoms got so bad. I’m finally down to 0 now and had my first Stelara injection about three weeks ago. I know it can take time for it to fully kick in, but since tapering to 10mg I’ve noticed more urgency and looser stools again. No bad cramping and blood so that's good. 

At 20mg I was feeling a lot better — more solid BMs and less urgency — so I’m scared it’s starting to get worse as I taper off. My GI said we can go back up to 20mg and taper by 5mg each week to give Stelara more time to work, but I really don’t want to be on prednisone any longer than I have to.

Right now it’s not horrible, compared to what it was when I was first diagnosed but I can definitely see it potentially progressing worse but idk beacuse it so unpredictable. so I’m thinking of monitoring things for a few days to see if they improve before starting the new taper. But I feel stuck — like do I wait until things get bad and risk a flare, or go back up early and stay on prednisone even longer? The long term side effects also scare me.

Should I take my meds, or eat tbh, before the infusion?



But mostly, I wanna hear success stories of it!  I think that if I preload my brain with positive things I'll be less anxious and therefore less prone to any sorta disaster happening.

230,Stelara,Communication with Boss,"For a little context. The past two weeks I was on a vacation overseas.

But of course like any other trip It sometimes takes me a bit longer to get adjusted to my timezone and etc. Which normally results in me having headaches and a lot of cramping and etc. How do I possibly say I can’t make the work trip, because frankly he should have been more considerate and not scheduled a trip the day I get back. Feel shitty having to potentially cancel on him because I need another day of rest to get up to speed. 

Just looking for others advice. My crohns is overall under control but take Stelara and deal with a lot of general fatigue and etc. You guys know how it is. Thanks.

234,Stelara,In desperate need of advice on Prednisone tapering and possible surgery options.,"Hello everyone, long story short I have been on and off of prednisone since being diagnosed in mid 2022. My highest dose was 30mg. Biologic wise I have tried and failed Remicade, Stelara, and Rinvoq. My most successful taper was on Stelara, where I was off prednisone for about two weeks. I was experiencing mild to severe symptoms below 5mg during that taper. My GI doctor concluded my symptoms were due to adrenal issues related to long term prednisone use and sent me to an endocrinologist. My endocrinologist concluded that my symptoms were due to active Crohn's disease and that my blood work showed my adrenals were fine.

I am currently on Entyvio and ""failed"" to taper off prednisone once again. It was basically the same story as what happened on Stelara. Now my GI doctor is recommending me get surgery to remove my ileocecal valve as there is noticeable scarring from years of undiagnosed Crohn's. My most recent colonoscopy showed that the valve is the only point of inflammation and it's at a minimal to mild level. Everything else looked healthy. 

This all being said, I want to try tapering off of prednisone once more before I throw the towel in for surgery. I want to believe that my previous tapers were too quick and that's why they failed. I was going down anywhere from 1-5mg a week during those previous tapers. 

How should I approach this taper attempt to ensure the best chance of success? What kind of symptoms are normal for tapering and which are signs that entyvio is not working for me?

For anyone who doesn’t know, steroids increase blood sugar levels and also significantly increases insulin resistance (insulin barely works to bring sugar down). Hardly ate anything today, and it’s still hovering around 350 at the moment.

239,Stelara,Does it get better?,"I was diagnosed in August after a long brutal wait of getting in to see a GI and having a colonoscopy. I’ve been on steroids since, and honestly the last two months have been brutal. It feels like my whole life has been taken over. All sense of normalcy for me is out the window— all I can do is lay down or run to the bathroom. Going to work has been horrible and I get no sleep. Beyond the physical pain, mentally it’s exhausting watching my life just pass me by.

I’ve struggled with tapering prednisone and (under my GI’s instructions) keep ending up back at 40mg. I hate to be on steroids for this long, but they’re the only thing keeping me barely afloat right now. I’m staying here until I can start my first infusion of Stelara, hopefully in the next couple weeks. But I’m so tired and discouraged. I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I know the goal is to get into remission with biologics, but the “what ifs” take over my head. What if the medication doesn’t work? Will I ever feel normal again? Will I ever be able to enjoy coffee, alcohol, and food without worrying? i am also terrified of side effects from medication. Oh and also surgery? I know that's not the case for everyone but gosh that is scary. 

I feel like I’m in constant fight-or-flight, and reading posts about people being stuck in flares for years makes me so scared. I just want to know — does it get better?

241,Stelara,Parenting a toddler as a parent with Crohn’s,"I’m 34, have been battling with Crohn’s for 17 years, but right now am on a generic of Stelara and while there’s no visible inflammation (both on scope and labs), I’ve been feeling really terrible lately. Fatigued, nauseous, weak, dizzy, and it’s all creating a pretty short fuse and anxiety. I am currently seeing doctors and have imaging/scopes scheduled to try and fix things. 

However - I am a stay at home mom to a 14 month old perfect, hilarious, tiny tornado - he’s my favorite person on earth and I’ve been feeling like a terrible mom. I don’t feel physically capable of chasing him around the house, or taking him out to playgrounds etc, due to my dizziness and weakness. But he just learned to walk and it’s all he wants to (and should) do. 
He wants to do puzzles and stack rings and play but I’m so fatigued that it’s hard for me to get up and be engaged with him. 

My husband is WONDERFUL and so involved and helps wherever he can during the day, but he does work and can’t realistically take the time off to be a primary caregiver in my stead while I rest. We don’t have family nearby to help us out and I feel like I could potentially be feeling better if I just had the time to rest uninterrupted. But I also feel guilty because we are equal partners in parenting and when I feel awful he’s doing SO much. 

Sesame Street is pulling a lot of weight right now and I’m beating myself up hard over it - I see mom friends taking their babies out to do so many things and I get so stressed that my baby is bored, or not being stimulated enough, or doesn’t like me because I don’t have the energy right now. 

We aren’t considering a nanny or daycare at this time - certainly not daycare due to the constant viruses - a simple cold knocks me out for weeks because of my immune suppression.

It has also started happening at random times walking, sitting, working, etc. I have tried all the creams prep h, diaper rash, Vaseline, witch hazel wipes, sits baths every day with epsom salt and wet wipes and I’m looking into a bidet, I also try not to sit on the toilet for too long when using the bathroom.


All of this is to say I’m miserable i need some kind of relief. I usually don’t bring this issue up bc it’s embarrassing.. ik I’ve got to get over that but I am a 21 f and im still new to all of this. My appointments are just normal visits I don’t get exams or anything (not that I really want too) but idk what else to do really I feel like I coudl try a if prescription cream if he offers but I also feel like it may  not work like the others I’m alrdy using what else can u really do though?  how do yall get over the itching and burning?!?!? 

anyone who has experienced this issue was it actually from hemorrhoids or was it fissures and did it get better with a specific cream or treatment? ",2025-08-27 00:33:45,CrohnsDisease,1,1n12swz,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n12swz/does_the_burn_stop_help/,2025-08-27
252,Stelara,Vent - Colonoscopy Prep w/SuTab Pills,"So prep has been ... Going.
I wound up taking the first dose over the span of an hour due to how large the pills are.  I wound up having to crush them and put them in little capsules to take them, just cause I'm sorry but those pills are BIG AND HARD!  They broke my pill cutter!
Once the drama of that was aside (I've already done the encapsulating for the second dose), I worried they weren't working. I've never used the pills before, only the miralax cocktail. But damn when these things start working they start WORKING!
Seriously. I tried to rest and woke up in a puddle (clear puddle, so not too gross).

I don't want to spend all of my existence in the bathroom!  It's just so unfair!  I want to be able to lay down and REST! I have been awake for a LONG time (I woke up at 4.30 AM. It is 9.35 PM)

I gotta take more laxatives at 6 am? How is this fair in any measure of the word?



For some context, I'm 26F and currently flaring (managing with Prednisone at 20mg) or so we think?  I just wanna know if Stelara is working for me or not honestly.  This disease is exhausting, and colonoscopy prep even more so....",2025-08-26 04:37:15,CrohnsDisease,2,1n0clp6,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n0clp6/vent_colonoscopy_prep_wsutab_pills/,2025-08-26
253,Stelara,What is remission,"I have been in a flare for over four years now. Had my second small bowel resection last March. 

Have failed Stelara and currently on Skyrizi which I started in March, have done the three infusions and have now had two home injections.

After the second infusion my condition improved significantly but still had very bad diarrhoea, fatigue and some stomach pain/nausea. But things were much improved and I thought if this was it then this is ok. Not good by any means but ok.

However my symptoms now seem to be getting worse which has been confirmed by bloods/calprotectin.

I’ll have to wait until October to get an MRI to see whether we change medications then.

Anyway with this latest backwards step I’m really struggling to stay positive. I’ve a young family to support and a business I run which is very demanding.

I am just really keen to understand what remission means for other people with Crohn’s. 

Do you ever forget you have Crohn’s?
Do you have constant diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea etc?
Can you go out and have a few drinks without consequence?
Can you eat out/eat what you want without consequence?
Work long hours, handle stressful situations?

I have a lot to be thankful for, really great medical team, amazing family etc but I’m just wondering whether I will ever get to a place where I feel good again.

Thanks in advance!

256,Stelara,I’m in remission but I feel like shit,"I’ve been living with Crohn’s for 8 years now. I got diagnosed when I was 20 years old. Obviously the first couple of years was rough trying to get into remission. I was on Remicade which brought the inflammation down but made me feel horrible otherwise. It even gave me drug induced lupus (this is a very rare side effect). During that time, I definitely had food sensitivities but I got to a point of being somewhat “regular” with my bowel movements. It really didn’t get in the way of me living my life. Since then I have switched over to Stelara which has been good. Over 2 years ago, something shifted. I now go to the bathroom a minimum of 2 times a day but it’s now becoming 4-6 times. I started getting anxiety about it when I was traveling in Europe and basically had an “accident” at the Rome airport. I don’t know how much of it is now anxiety causing my stomach to always turn when I have somewhere to be, or if it’s really just my life now. Getting on public transportation to get work is so anxiety inducing for me since there is no bathroom on the subway. It’s now seeping into my social life. I’m afraid to go to friends houses or even out anywhere because I fear I’m going to have to go to the bathroom in public or in a time and place that is super inconvenient. I feel extremely depressed, like it’s taking my life away from me. I don’t want to feel like this anymore but I can’t tell what’s really my Crohn’s or what’s anxiety anymore. I took a lorazepam the other day to see if my stomach would be calmer, and it wasn’t so now I just feel like this is my life.

Well it’s definitely not… ever since the switch my symptoms have been flaring a lot I’m getting way more stomach cramping and I’m not absorbing things like normal. Let’s just say one of my medications I take for anxiety went in and out the other side undigested.
my current gastroenterologist has said he’s working on switching me back, however I’m due for my dose soon and it still doesn’t look like it’s changed back.

258,Stelara,IBS? Or flare? Please help me :(,"Hi all, 
Diagnosed with Crohn’s April 2024.  
I’m a bedside nurse who working rotating shifts, currently on nights. Also just had a very stressful move, and I have been fighting off and on again with my fiancé. 

Lab work normal, scope normal, last calprotectin very recently was normal. 

I have been having diarrhea, some nausea, and some pain for almost 2 weeks (since the move). I also had diarrhea before the move right after switching to nightshift that resolved after about a week. 

I switched from Stelara to Skyrizi because I thought I had a flare, but wondering now if it was just from stress, as my scope and biopsies were completely normal and they said I was in remission. However, they said it would be fine to switch to Skyrizi to see if it helped more with symptoms. 

I’m at a loss. Does this sound like IBS? How do I manage this??

261,Stelara,WWYD Flare up question semi urgent feedback appreciated,"I am in an active flare due to being off Stelara for 2 years because of an out of state move to escape DV.  I’ve had a bowel resection, three bowel surgeries with complications due to fistulas, a temporary colostomy bag and I fractured my femur a few years ago so I have a hip replacement. I am 36, F. 

I saw a new GI for the first time last Wednesday and have gotten the ball rolling on getting scopes and such done so I can get back on a regimen to hopefully get me in remission again. Unfortunately I’ve been flaring pretty wildly for about 2-3 weeks with all the symptoms. 

I’ve put myself on a liquid diet and pumped myself full of ginger tea and tried Tylenol and bentyl to no avail during this time. The day before my appointment last week (Tuesday) I was seen in the ER because the pain had gotten so severe I could no longer wait for my Wednesday appointment. I have a decently high pain tolerance and don’t like to complain and I don’t like when people fuss but this chronic discomfort is starting to really really wear me down. 

They managed my pain and scanned and xrayed me and ran blood work etc and told me they debated on admitting me but because I had the new GI appointment scheduled for the next morning (Wednesday) at 8:30 am they told me to go home and gave me a dose of pain medicine before I left along with a script for zofran. After seeing the GI last Wednesday the morning after my ER visit and getting a script for prednisone the next day I am finding that my symptoms are not improving at all and they’ve only gotten worse through the weekend. It’s been almost a week since this process has started and My Monday has become extra miserable and I find myself unable to eat or sleep or spend too much time too far from a lavatory. My mental health is in shambles and I’m in a lot of stress theses days due to an ongoing custody situation with my ex partner so although I try to keep stress low I am still struggling every day with intrusive thoughts and feeling so world weary and overwhelmed. I am seeing a psychiatrist to help manage my depression and anxiety about this situation but am honestly struggling and feeling at the end of my rope more often than not these days. I miss my baby, I miss feeling well enough to go to work or eat a meal. I’ve lost 13 pounds in 2 months putting me at a whopping 113lbs. I don’t feel good about the way I look or feel and I am so tired. 


All this to say…it’s 9:30 pm on Monday morning and the pain is awful and I have no specific plan of action to help manage this pain until I can get a colonoscopy/endoscopy scheduled so I can get my induction doses of my meds going again. As of right now the GI office scheduled me for a follow up in FEBRUARY 2026.

Do I drive myself down to the ER knowing I will be most likely waiting for hours before being admitted if at all but they may be able to give me some IV fluids, steroids and pain meds while I wait and maybe get fast tracked to a scope?  

Pros: -I may get some relief from the IV fluids, 
        -a Monday night may mean a longer wait but it will hopefully be a little mellower even if I’m waiting in a hallway (I usually bring my AirPods and listen to a podcast or try to crochet while i disassociate until the next time someone checks in on me)
        -I will be out of my shoebox apartment I’ve been stuck in for over a week and can maybe people watch while I wait 
        -I will feel proactive about advocating for myself which is not something I am used to 

Cons: - I am a very hard stick, they tried 8 times then finally busted out the ultrasound to get a line in after 4 hours of me being triaged last week 
      - I could be sitting there for hours feeling even more anxious and uncomfortable than I would at home 
      - I don’t want to have my roommate wake up and feel obligated to come wait with me if they wake up in the middle of the night and find I have driven myself over (we live about 10 mins from hospital and they always insist on coming along if they can which I am grateful for but they commute to work on the 4 am train and need their sleep because of their own seizure disorder) 

Should I just wait and try to go to an urgent care tomorrow even though the pain has gotten to the point where I can’t even finish a row of my crochet without messing up and having to redo it over and over. I’m going a bit stir crazy trying to decide! I am not asking for medical advice I just need help figuring out what to do. 

Thanks for reading.

I’ve been on a waiting list (supposedly) for 1 year in the public healthcare system. I’ve been trying to get help via the private system (I have Cigna insurance) but they say they can’t help me with prescriptions, that it all needs to be via the public system.

264,Stelara,GI pushing ostomy,"I was diagnosed with undifferentiated ulcerative colitis at age 15, tried azathioprine and prednisone many times that failed until Remicade worked for me and put me into an almost (was taking Tylenol 3 daily for pain) remission until I was 21. I then got diagnosed with arthritis as well and started Stelara which again made life semi manageable. I got the diseased part of my colon removed at age 25, which provided relief for a whole 2 months. At this point GI changed diagnosis to Crohns. I had surgery complications (2 ecoli infections, bowels didn't work for a few days so NG tube, free floating fluid etc. Luckily recovered from that). I was told I was failing Stelara but got pregnant at age 26 (5 years on stelara) and felt the best I ever have. Then 6 weeks post-partum I had a major flare. On prednisone multiple times to no avail. Started sulfasalazine mostly for arthritis and failed stelara and began Rinvoq in May. I ended up with major flares of both arthritis and crohns as well as an upper respiratory infection that had me off of Rinvoq for a month. After starting again for about a month and a half my GI tells me he will complete a colonoscopy in August (2 weeks away) and if my colon is diseased I will be referred for an end ileostomy as I don't have anymore biologic options (I am also located in Canada if that makes a difference).

All this to say I feel that is a bit abrupt and definite... While my day to day is far from ideal I am able to function. I do use the washroom upwards of 10 times a day, loose stool and passing blood. However, my pain is manageable and I am able to complete my daily needs and care for my baby.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar? What options were available when failing biologics and prednisone is no help? I am just concerned of making such a final decision of an ostomy if there are other potential options as I would rather exhaust them all before a final surgery.",2025-07-20 03:06:54,CrohnsDisease,1,1m4eiiq,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m4eiiq/gi_pushing_ostomy/,2025-07-20
271,Stelara,My next treatment (recommendations),"Diagnosed back in 2022. Started out on Remicade, was working well until I became allergic and broke out in hives mid infusion. 

From there we moved to Stelara, I liked being able to inject at home. But after a little over a year I saw very little improvement. Still had a lot of frequency. After about 8 or so months I asked my gi if maybe I needed a more frequent dose instead of every 8 weeks. To which he responded “ man your tricky! I think I want to send you to a different specialist” I was annoyed and didn’t even feel heard. I stayed on the same dose a while longer before the company I worked from home for went bankrupt and then i got laid off and lost my insurance. 

From there I went untreated for about 8 months without it being much different than being on Stelara. 

Well last year was crazy and I lost my job, insurance and father unexpectedly and just sort of became numb. 

It finally caught up with me and I spun into one of the worst flares I’ve ever had. 15+ days of no eating, body rejecting anything I put in it. Hospitalized for 4 days to get on fluids and iv steroids. Now out on prednisone but it doesn’t do a thing to help me. Currently wasting away dropping weight rapidly. 

Anyway I have new insurance active July 1st and am going to get back on a treatment again and want to know what people would recommend for me. 

Also, my old gi doctor is leaving the office so I get to start fresh with a new one which I’m happy about.

I do have fistualizing Crohn’s but it doesn’t really bother me if I maintain it and keep things very clean. 

I’m curious about skyrizzi which I hear a lot about. But I think I’d like to go in with some options.

Any guidance is helpful. And I hope you are doing well with managing your Crohn’s. It’s taken my life away these past few years. I just want my life back. ",2025-06-26 22:52:19,CrohnsDisease,1,1lle6a0,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lle6a0/my_next_treatment_recommendations/,2025-06-26

281,Stelara,So frustrated and sad,"Hi everyone! 

  
This is a new account for me but I am a long time poster/reader of this subreddit. I appreciate this subreddit so so much. 

  
I have now failed 2 biologics within 3-3.5 years of diagnosis. I was on Stelara for 2-2.5 years going from every 8 weeks to every 4 weeks and multiple rounds of prednisone. From a colonoscopy it was obvious it wasn't effective, even with adequate therapeutic levels. I was switched to Renflexis in October of 2024, I have been on two rounds of prednisone between now and then. Today I was informed that I have a steroid dependency and Renflexis isn't working for me, even with adequate levels. And guess what, another round of steroids :D At a wayyyy higher dose (40 mg for two weeks, 35 mg for two weeks, 30 mg for two weeks etc.). I am also starting Envityo in July.

  
I have this feeling like I did something wrong. That I'm doing something wrong to prevent these medications from working. I have always metabolized medication quickly (Gravel, Tylenol, Lidocaine, etc.). But I just feel so lost and sad and alone. My partner is so supportive and sweet and optimistic but I just feel so alone with this. I am only 26 years old, what if I run out of options? I am already on 3/7(?) and I still have sooo much life ahead (Hopefully lol). 

  
Essentially, I just need some hope right now. I am so scared to run out of options. I am so scared that I will never achieve remission and I will always be on steroids. My nose and perianal space have constant reoccurring fissures that no one seems to care about. My toilet anxiety has gotten so bad. I can't even eat at work because otherwise I will be in the bathroom all day or so nauseous I can't even focus. 

  
Thank you in advance for anything you say. Truly just want to feel a little less alone. And some reassurance that I won't run out of biologic options. How long/many meds did it take you before you went into remission? What does remission even look like with Crohn's?

Other than mild gastric ulcerations and some erythematous-ness at the terminal ileum, his goddamn scopes are clear.

291,Stelara,finally thriving again,"I'm 16 years old and i was diagnosed with a pretty strong case of crohns disease in January of 2025. However the doctors think i have had it since 2020, based on my height and weight chart. in 2019 i was above the 90th percentile in both my height and weight. in January of this year i was 32nd percentile in height, and less than 1 percentile in weight. honestly i don't know how more concerns weren't brought up earlier. 

I just was getting this really strong pains that would come in waves in my lower right abdomen. doctors didnt know what it was, but they knew i had a family history of crohns. it does upset me that all of the signs were there. However i never had the issue of going to the bathroom a significant amount of times a day. the area my crohns affected didnt create that symptom. 

After going to the emergency and a CT scan they saw a pretty large abscess, so i had a handful of drains and antibiotics. i spent a total of 50 days in the hospital exactly across 3 trips. i didnt eat food from January 17- april 9, i had an NG tube. I had a surgery scheduled in late april but went back late march because of a bowel obstruction. So i had my surgery april 7 and they took out 12 inches of my small intestine and took down the fistula which was way better than they expected, they think because of the fact i was on that formula diet it really helped everything heal. 

i also live with an ileostomy bag now until late july they will do a reversal surgery to re connect everything hopefully. 

first trip i tried stelara, wasnt quick enough to close the fistula so we switched to inflectra, it didnt close the fistula, and maybe caused that obstruction, so now after the surgery we went back to stelara and hope everything works. 

now though ive been doing fantastic, i have had an appetite, gained 30 pounds in the past month, lots of more energy. feels great to be on the comeback to life after 5 years. if youve got any questions or comments let me know!",2025-06-09 00:28:19,CrohnsDisease,17,1l6rae2,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l6rae2/finally_thriving_again/,2025-06-09

They had me on Remicade for over a year before finally deciding it wasn't working; and I've now been using Stelara since the beginning of this year. They said it should start taking effect within the first 4 shots, but as it is June and I inject myself every 4 weeks, I have yet to improve. I wake up feeling extremely sick, and go throughout the day with a constant, whether subtle or prominent, discomfort or pain. According to the lovely people taking care of it, I've yet to enter remission. 

I have discovered that milk helps with the pain; although, makes me sick. Is there literally anything I can do to alleviate the symptoms or pain the illness comes with? I have to take Iron pills and Vitamin pills once a week, and omeprazole x2 every single day. &lt;/3

297,Stelara,Medication insight - attempt 3 at remission,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with severe perianal + colitis crohns in January 2024. I started infliximab (Remicade) and had a lay open for a perianal fistula in April.

My infliximab helped, it brought my calprotectin down from 1200 to 740, however I had to be moved from 8 weekly to 4 weekly infusions as I felt I was running out of medicine by week 6. In December last year, my stool test results came back at 1100, and it was decided to change my medicine.

I started Ustekinumab (stelara) in January of this year. February I felt completely unmedicated, flared violently and got really depressed. I felt infliximab was working as I felt much better on it and was confused as to why my stool tests had jumped up again. I begged my nurses to change as I knew stelara wasn’t working but was only told to give it time.

Finally in April my GI looked at my recent calprotectin — 2000&gt;. I was then prescribed Upadacitnib (Rinvoq) but couldn’t take it until I had been 4 weeks without Azathioprane.

After 4 weeks, my fistula issues returned and I had to get them checked out before starting Rinvoq. I was cleared last Wednesday and I’m now a few days into Rinvoq.

299,Stelara,Scared of it coming back,"I am just so terrified, I’ve been mostly in remission after a surgery and getting on Stelara in 2020, and  because of insurance changes I haven’t been on Stelara in four months.

Today I felt it come creeping back. The pain is bad but not terrible, but I’m so fucking terrified of having to go through this again if I’m immune to Stelara now. What if it doesn’t work anymore? How long until I get a medication prescribed and then insurance approval and then how long until it works, if it works?

Months, is the answer. Everything is months and months and months of pain and waiting with this disease.

I’m so scared.",2025-05-27 23:06:51,CrohnsDisease,4,1kx1pt8,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kx1pt8/scared_of_it_coming_back/,2025-05-27
301,Stelara,Bedside nurses out there?,"Hi all!! 

I’m 28F, diagnosed with Crohn’s last year. In endoscopic remission but still have some lingering symptoms so we switched up my biologic from Stelara to Skyrizi in March (still hopeful that this will help!!) 

I’m currently working as a bedside nurse, and love working as a nurse, and I’m hoping to work either ICU or ER as my next job, but worried about the stress aspect… 

Any nurses out there have any thoughts??

304,Stelara,Skyrizi… how long til it works?,"Hi all! 
I was diagnosed in April 2024 and started Stelara a month after. 
It took like 4-5 months for it to fully take effect, and then I had a flare in January. 
I had my scope a few weeks after and it looked totally normal! Remission! 

Despite that, we moved to Skyrizi in hopes for better symptom management. 

I have had my 3rd infusion and will have my OBI in 2 weeks. 
I’m completely off of prednisone, but noticing I am having some abdominal pain and looser stools (sometimes diarrhea). 

How long for Skyrizi to work before we toss it and try something else? My doctor told me a few months but since my colon looked so great she didn’t think it would be that long… 

Thanks! ",2025-05-13 23:21:20,CrohnsDisease,1,1km0khq,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1km0khq/skyrizi_how_long_til_it_works/,2025-05-13
306,Stelara,Am I justified in being angry at my doctor?,"Apologies for the long post. I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease last week, which was a bit of a shock, and I'm not sure if my frustration stems from feeling pretty down overall about the diagnosis or genuine bad practices by my doctor.

For context, I had what I now know is a flare up about about six months ago prior to the winter holidays. It took several weeks for me to get an appointment with my PCP due to the holidays, and by then my symptoms had gone away. After several labs/tests/scans run through my PCP didn't show anything, they referred me to a PE-run GI practice,. By the time I met with my GI, I had not had symptoms for three months, and I informed them of that.

I had a colonoscopy done and initially after the colonoscopy, my doctor believed it was an ulcerative colitis diagnosis, as the inflammation was very minimal and localized only to the left side of the colon. The biopsy came back showing chronic inflammation, however, so Crohn's disease it is.

My doctor briefly met with me to give me the diagnosis in person, and then immediately sent me to the nurse to talk about the medication he recommended (Stelara). It seemed like a very quick and efficient way to deliver a potential life-altering diagnosis, but maybe I was in a stupor and didn't ask questions. They sent me home with an info packet on Stelara after talking about the benefits of it and told me to call back once I could confirm I thought it would work for me.

I read the info packet, and I noticed that it said I should not be around anyone with live vaccines when taking the medication. My wife and I are expecting twins next week (our first kids), who will obviously be getting a bunch of vaccines over the next year. 

I called the doctor's office to ask if it was an issue, and they called me back and said they didn't foresee any issues because ""while we would never recommend this for a mom, because childcare is their primary responsibility, you can take Stelara and take two week breaks from being in close contact with your children whenever they receive a vaccine."" This flippant way of saying my wife could handle all the childcare on her own and I would miss the first 25% of my kids' lives in the first six months was a bit shocking to me.

I let them know that wasn't practical for us and asked if there was alternative medication I could take for the first six months or so, until the bulk of the vaccines were completed. They said they could prescribe an oral medication until I was ready to take Stelara and that they would call back with more information. Great! 

But then they never called back, and I received a notification from my pharmacy a week later that I had been prescribed a medication without context. I looked up the medication, and it apparently has the same live vaccine issue as Stelara. I have called the doctor's office back numerous times to see if they had any concerns, but they have been non-responsive and I get sent to voicemail, so I haven't picked up the medication yet.

Also, just a side complaint, but every time I speak to my doctor, he asks me how I'm managing my symptoms, and I always have to let him know that I haven't had symptoms in six months, and he always expresses surprise at that. It just feels like they're not really paying attention to anything, possibly prescribing me dangerous medication in terms of potential bad consequences when exposed to live vaccines, and giving me zero guidance. 

I'm not normally one to complain / would generally follow a doctor's recommendation, but I'm just upset and concerned right now and I have no idea if it's worth it to drop them and find a new doctor, despite that seeming like a nightmare for insurance purposes/additional delays to getting needed medication.

tldr:

\-Doctor did not remember my symptoms despite telling them multiple times.

\-Doctor encouraged me to miss 25% of my babies' first six months of life so I could take a medication and said it wouldn't be an issue because my wife could handle everything and I was just a dad.

\-After coming up with an alternative medication plan, doctor then prescribed me a medication without consultation that had the same exact issue.",2025-05-13 14:26:27,CrohnsDisease,8,1klnaxf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1klnaxf/am_i_justified_in_being_angry_at_my_doctor/,2025-05-13
309,Stelara,Switched from Stelara to Pyzchiva.,"So I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 10 years ago. I’ve had one bowel resection and been on 2 different biologics. After being absolutely fine on Stelara for 8 years, I was put on Pyzchiva because it was cheaper. Now I’m so unwell I’ve got to have all usual tests to check for inflammation and antibodies. I said I didn’t want to switch and was assured it’s “so similar it won’t make a difference”. After the first dose I was unwell. My consultant said it wouldn’t be the injection. Now I’ve spoke to someone else at the IBD clinic and she said most patients that were switched are coming back to them ill. Depending on my test results I could be put back onto stelara but now there’s no guarantee it will work. 

Anyone else? ",2025-05-11 09:37:15,CrohnsDisease,3,1kjx70c,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kjx70c/switched_from_stelara_to_pyzchiva/,2025-05-11
310,Stelara,I’m just exhausted,"I guess this is just more of a vent than anything. It’s difficult to talk about it with anyone in my life as they just don’t understand. I’ve been fighting a relapse since 2023. Currently on Stelara, which is my second medication since I’ve relapsed and I have no idea what is going on with my body anymore. My calprotectin at the beginning of April came back at 1500, so I was put on budesonide for 3 months. However, I also tested positive for Covid during that time, so my doctor isn’t convinced it’s my Crohn’s, since I haven’t really had much abdominal pain, which is usually a telltale symptom for me that my Crohn’s is flaring. So I’ve done a repeat calprotectin which I will ring to get the results next week. My doctor has also told me to start tapering my budesonide early so now I’m only on 6mg a day, supposed to be dropping down to 3mg next week.

Since the beginning of January, I have had back to back infections, from the Flu to tonsillitis to norovirus. I pretty much only have a few weeks to recover before I get another infection. I have yet another infection currently, I think it’s strep, which I had back in March and needed antibiotics for. I also have conjunctivitis that I am recovering from earlier in the week. This will be my seventh infection this year. Today I started getting Crohn’s pain again. I have no idea if these infections are causing flares or if it’s because Stelara isn’t working well enough or both. 

I am just so drained, I have to nap during the day just so I can function. I’m practically on the same sleep schedule as my 9 month old nephew. My iron levels are also apparently fine. I just want to be healthy again and not constantly feel like my body is failing. I’m 25 years old, I’m supposed to be out there living my life, but instead, I’m asleep for half of it and on the toilet for the other half.

I just got a disturbing letter in the mail that my super expensive university (state) insurance is no longer covering my Stelara as of July 1 of this year. They’re essentially forcing people to switch to other “biosimilars”. I’m super distraught and upset as it took like six months to get prior authorization + 2 months of really rough side effects after my first infusion. Now I’m acclimated, in remission, with very little side effects. There’s a potential option to submit a preauth to continue to stay on it, but knowing how insurance companies work, fighting tooth and nail for their bottom line, I’m feeling somewhat hopeless. I’m wondering if anyone has gone through this and/or has any hope for getting approval after coverage is discontinued. I am on a copay assistance program but I doubt that would cover the out of pocket costs if I had 0 insurance coverage.

However I can’t really tell if it’s just been more noticeable because I have to take off work or wfh every time but I still think it’s been more frequent.
I will definitely bring this up at my next gi appt, but I was wondering if anyone has any tips or insight on what they do to prevent getting sick with the whole suppressed immune system thing.

323,Stelara,Surgery or Stick to Biologics,"My father got diagnosed with Crohn's 3 years back ( 61 ). His symptoms were severe Blood loss and occassional stomach pain. We were given steroids + Immunosuppresents earlier and then we're put on Adalimumab. For 2 years Adalimumab did well, the blood wasn't dropping as much ( never stabilized ), we needed Iron Infusions occassionally. For the past 3 months, he had severe Diarrhea and now after DBE ( Double ballon Enteroscopy )we saw few strictures. The doctor has given us two options either switch to Stelara or Surgery to remove those strictures. ( He himself suggested us earlier that surgery won't be effective in Crohn's as it can reoccur ). Now we are so confused because Stelara is just super expensive in India and Surgery might be good for a few months but ulcers can reappear anywhere else and form strictures. We suggested him to give us any other Biologic like infliximab but he says that it won't work because Adalimumab works the same way ( TNF Blockers ).

326,Stelara,"My fiancee and I are at the end of our rope and need help (Oregon, US)","My fiancee, 27F, was diagnosed with Crohns a couple of years ago at this point. We started the long grueling process of getting her set up with a Gastroenterologist. At first she was put on Budesonide to manage her symptoms. She was on that for, I think, a year and a half, which we were told was WAY too long. Finally last year we were able to get her put on Inflectra. That worked beautifully until it started giving her Migratory Arthritis which was debilitating, as in massive pain, swelling and fluid buildup. The first instance was in her hip and it literally traveled down her entire leg. The second time was in her shoulder and traveled all the way down to her fingers, hitting every area along the way. After that second time we were able to figure out that it was the Inflectra causing that and since that was entirely unlivable, she had to go off of it and back onto Budesonide as a stopgap until we could get her onto Stelara.

That was like 3 months ago.

We are being completely stonewalled by her Gastro's medical assistant who will not return her calls or calls her back in the early morning when we're asleep or when she's at work and cannot answer the phone and **does not leave a message.**

Last we heard she had submitted to the insurance company for a prior authorization for the Stelara. Knowing all this takes time we were told to wait to hear from the specialist pharmacy and all that jazz. Well after finally having had enough and running out of Budesonide AGAIN we called the insurance company (Regence Group Administrators, not the same as Blue Cross/Blue Shield) to see what's up. They then informed us that they never even received a prior authorization request. This has completely broken her and she is talking about ending herself because we are now back to being reliant on a person that could not give less of a shit about her to actually do her job.

We do not have a ton of money, we're basically out of savings and I am also disabled and can't work so things are dire. I have literally pleaded, begged with people, she has done the same.

What can we do? This is literal torture. I just called the infusion place to plead with them to somehow work out getting the Inflectra without the prior auth. Her insurance is supposedly pretty good and is through her work but we are at the mercy of a Gastroenterologist that is booked literally a full year out and there isn't another available one for hundreds of miles around. We live in Southern Oregon and ~~her Gastro is up in Portland.~~  (**EDIT:** Apparently I was mistaken and it is somebody in Medford that she got transferred to at some point, I did not realize that had happened in all the mess.)

If she takes her own life because of this absolute horseshit I... am not gonna say anything further but just use your imagination for what will happen next.

I am begging. I need ideas. I need some path forward. Even if they are less than legal.

**EDIT:** First off I want to thank all of you for responding so quickly and with so many suggestions. Was in an absolute panic when I made this post after hours of trying the phones with various offices and stuff. I am overwhelmed with the positivity and kindness you have all shown and I will eventually get to responding to each of you individually in time.

Before I made this post I had talked with the receptionist and plead our case to see if she would physically go interact with the relevant people and while she did not do that, she put me in touch with somebody that did call my fiancee back within the hour and we have an immediate path forward for the moment but going forward I agree we need to find another provider for this and we are going to look into a lot of your suggestions.

Due to the current political climate I'm not going to specify this next part but I will say we are also both people that the current administration is attacking and as you can imagine that has weighed heavily on us both all year. Today specifically we learned some very terrifying information that while not directly linked to us is very concerning and so it was all too much for us in the moment. **It's currently late and my fiancee has gone to bed but I relayed your compassion to her and it absolutely makes a difference so again, thank you very much.** I plan to start responding to people tomorrow but there are no words to adequately express my gratitude.

  
**EDIT 2:** She was beside herself reading all your wonderful comments and again I cannot overstate how much you all have helped us just mentally so know your efforts were not unnoticed or in vain. We'll be looking into getting her transferred to a new GI ASAP once her immediate needs are met and we have a path forward to get that done.

The world needs more kindness and people like yourselves so again, thank you so much for the support, it does make a difference. I will keep updating the post with news as we navigate through the processes.

I’m 3-4 weeks late with my Stelara and it’s starting to show with my physical health. I’m not eating much. Beyond that, I’m incredibly stressed out with life. 

Today is my birthday, too. I’m in the ER, alone, because he told me “I can’t come with you I have to work” (he works remote) and he wanted me out at 9am, no excuses. My stomach hurt all night last night and I was in the bathroom a lot. 

He said he would follow me to the ER (45 mins) to make sure I was “ok” but if they release me I would have to drive home (3.5hrs), I couldn’t stay at his house tonight because he has his kids tomorrow. 

Yall I’m just tired. I wanted to vent. I’ve never been around someone upset for me having a chronic illness I can do nothing about. :(

Edit: he’s seen this post (he knows my Reddit)… ok good. Now you know you’ve hurt me.

344,Stelara,Frustration with GI and Symptoms,"This is part a vent, and partly I'm hoping you might have some ideas for me. I've been having diarrhea and abdominal cramping for almost a year. Last spring, I thought it was my Crohn's flaring up. I went for an MRE and it showed mild inflammation in my small intestine. My GI increased my Stelara from 6 to 4 weeks and I did a course of prednisone. This was the first time in my 20 years of having CD, the prednisone did nothing. The diarrhea persisted. I have had elevated WBC for almost a year. My sed rate was on the high end of normal, and that some times is indicative of a flare for me, but CRP was fine. In December we did a scope and my intestines looked the best they ever have. The GI declared my Crohn's still in remission. Since I was having more side effects from the Stelara we backed down to 6 weeks again, and the side effects resolved.

I saw the GI again yesterday. She thinks is IBS. I take hycosamine for the abdominal cramping and that's effective, but I have anywhere from 1-6 BMs a day, and some are very urgent. My digestive track is either running fast or slow, with no in between. If I try taking Imodium to slow it down then it grinds to a halt and I battle constipation. The GI keeps pushing fiber on me, and I have never really found fiber helpful. When I was a kid I was diagnosed with spastic colon and the fix was to increase my fiber, but it never helped. I've been taking 4 teaspoons of benefiber every morning. I tolerate it better than psyllium. 

I can't live like this. I'm so frustrated that I cried during my appointment. The GI then pushed antidepressants on me to treat both the diarrhea and my mood. I tried antidepressants for mood and migraines and I never tolerate them well. So then she referred me to a social worker. I have a therapist. And honestly I don't think being upset at pooping your pants more in the last year than in your life, as well as not being able to make plans, is unreasonable. I realize it could very well be IBS, but this has gone on longer than I have ever experienced.

She did blood work and my sed rate was just outside of normal at 41. It was 31 during the summer. My WBC was back to normal, and CRP was 10, down from 15 over the summer. 

She mentioned I had some overlap with SIBO symptoms and offered to have me try Rifaximin, but said it can be expensive and hard to get insurance to cover it. It felt like a bit of a grasp, but maybe I should try that. While this could be be ""just"" IBS, my ""gut"" tells me there's something else going on.

Any ideas? She referred me back to a nutritionist as well. I did FODMAP years ago, and I'm not in a place where I feel up to going done a restrictive eating path. Last time pushed me towards disordered eating. I'm dealing with chronic migraine on top of this, and I don't have a lot of energy to mess with my diet.

So frustrating to be pushed towards things that don't take the whole picture into consideration.",2025-03-20 02:14:15,CrohnsDisease,6,1jfehmw,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jfehmw/frustration_with_gi_and_symptoms/,2025-03-20
347,Stelara,Stelara to Skyrizi,"After 3 months of Stelara and landing in the hospital with a possible intussusception at the TI I was given a 4 week taper of prednisone for the first time. Prednisone is working.

I'll be joining the skyrizi gang now. 

My GI is a bit stumped on my diagnoses. I'm not really meeting his criteria for cronhs, but he didn't know what else it would be, so he's kind of accepting that it's cronhs. Other than high calprotectin, none of my labs show evidence for crohn's. He said the colonoscopy biopsies show inflammation at TI but not necessarily ""cronhs inflammation."".  I have another colonoscopy scheduled to look in there again. On it goes.

355,Stelara,Switched to Yesintek (Stelara biosimilar),"This is mostly a rant, but if anyone has any advice to offer, I would appreciate that too!

I've been on Stelara for 4 years and it's worked great! Additionally the copay assistance program made it super affordable for me, and was relatively easy to navigate. I recently got a new job and now my insurance is Kaiser (Northern California), so my GI and pharmacy are Kaiser as well. A few days ago they sent me a message saying they are changing all Stelara prescriptions to Yesintek (a newly approved biosimilar), and that my prescriber approved it. I'm fine to try the biosimilar, and I understand Kaiser wants to save costs, but I was shocked how sudden it was. My next dose is due tomorrow and I hardly had time to read about Yesintek, and no time to talk to my GI about it (who didn't mention anything when I last saw her a couple months ago).

The main thing is the copay assistance program. Yesintek has a copay assistance program, but the site is not very good. I submitted the application online but the final page which had my copay card number wasn't loading correctly, and then disappeared before I could write it down. I thought that would be fine, I would just log in, but there's no log in or patient portal on their website, only the option to submit another application (which doesn't seem to work, since I already did it once). I called the copay assistance phone number for the manufacturer Biocon Biologics, and there wasn't a phone tree option for Yesintek so I hit another one. When I spoke to a rep, she said they didn't have a navigator group yet for Yesintek because its too new, so she couldn't tell me the card info. She suggested I call the medical info phone line, which I did. They were unhelpful, but took my contact information to call back. All I'm looking for is the copay card # to give to the pharmacy.

Kaiser did not previously take the Stelara copay assistance program like CVS pharmacy did, so I had to send in my EOBs for a rebate, which was frustrating but okay. I was on the phone with Kaiser and the J&amp;J copay assistance program for weeks trying to figure it all out, only for Kaiser to suddenly switch to a different medication suddenly anyway. Why wouldn't they give a notice ahead of time?

I'm supposed to take my dose tomorrow, so I'll probably just pick up the new medication and pay whatever the copay is. Hopefully they'll reimburse me but it's worth whatever it costs to not be sick. Still, I'm pissed and stressed that I had a medication and copay assistance program that was working fine, and Kaiser suddenly changed to a medication that should work the same but who knows, and that I'm unable to get copay assistance for, and the copay assistance program is clearly not ready. Ugh, thanks for reading.

Edit: On the third call of a different phone number, I was able to speak to someone who could give me my copay card ID, which I will try to bring to the Kaiser pharmacy tomorrow. That number for Biocon Biologics was 1-833-612-4626

2nd edit: Kaiser pharmacy took my copay card # at the pharmacy counter. They wrote it on a sticky note and after a little confusion, they were able to run the card, so I got the Yesintek and the savings program completely covered the copay. They said they will save the information in the system for next time. Hope this info helps for anyone else searching for this later.

356,Stelara,Anyone have pain in calves and tingling in feet and hands.,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to ask a quick question for the last few weeks I have bad pain in my calves. Mainly just the left. It started intermittently and mainly at night along with pins and needles sensation in my feet. It’s pretty much constant now along with some tingling in my wrists and hands. 
Could this be related to Crohn’s? I was first diagnosed last May at 41. I was initially started on stelara as I have previously had cancer. However I was changed to inflectra (infliximab) as the stellara wasn’t working. My calprotectin stayed above 1000. 
I guess I’m a little more concerned than normal as my mother has MS and I went down the rabbit hole of google and found a link. 
I will be speaking to my GI nurse tomorrow hopefully,to get the latest calprotectin results, and see if this is one for the GP. 
Just looking for some info before I speak to them. 
Thanks guys.

357,Stelara,Recently Diagnosed: Calprotectin score slightly above 5000 but I feel fine!?,"Hey everyone! So I’m very new to dealing with disease. Recently diagnosed (20M). Currently have pan colitis but my doctors are pretty sure it Crohns due to recital sparing. Any way, I’ve had lots of testing done recently and my blood work was all fairly normal. My Vitamin D is low but C-reactive protein was fairly normal. 

The colonoscopy and pathology results put me at moderate however my symptoms have been mild overall. I’ve never had bloody or mucousy stools nor any nausea or vomiting. I do get gassy ish a few times a day, but the cramping quickly passes when the gas does. 

I have chronic constipation due to a tortuous colon which is why when I started having daily loose stools I was like “I’m going normal? No something’s up” (along with cramping of course) but recently I’ve been even back to my own normal. Some urgency when I do have to go but it’s usually own once or twice a week (sometimes daily)

Anyway: the point! My calprotectin score was over 5000 and my doctors just called saying “uhmmm how are you feeling?” I was in class and like I’m pretty much fine besides the continued mild symptoms. This seemed to surprise him. My CT looked fairly good besides the moderate inflammation so why am feeling so fine!? Should I be concerned that there’s major damage being done without me feeling it. I just started Mesalamine while we wait for my insurance to approve Stelara because I wanted to avoid steroids. 

Any advice is welcomed!

367,Skyrizi,Insurance defrauding me?,"I switched to skyrizi late in the year, having already met my OOP max. When trying to fill the rx, anthem is telling me because Skyrizi is a specialty medication, it has to be applied to my family OOP max, which we still have $3900 remaining on. Even after that, we will still have to pay 20% of the medication (making my total due $6600). All of this is clearly an effort to get me to sign up for the copay accumulator program which I obviously don’t want to do. I have two huge problems with this 1. I am the only one in my family taking Skyrizi. How can they justify applying it to my family OOP max when I’ve already met my individual OOP max? And 2. How can I continue to owe 20% of the cost once we’ve met our family OOP max? 

I’ve been on specialty meds almost 20 years and have a finance degree—I am not an idiot and understand how insurance works. I’m so furious for myself and all the other people who blindly sign up for copay accumulators or select the wrong insurance policy because of lack of education and misinformation. I feel like I am being steamrolled into signing up for copay accumulator illegally because of all the smoke and mirrors and different answers each time I call.

372,Skyrizi,My Journey,"So many stories in here - people sharing when they’re in their worst, flaring, or maybe 25 years in remission. I hope I can provide some hope despite not being all the way in the clear. 

I went from virtually no symptoms to having a blockage in my TI about 7 weeks ago. I had stomach pains that got worse during the day and by 10pm I was throwing up. By 11pm I was throwing up what smelt like poop. By 3am I was in the ER getting a high dose of prednisone and a OG tube Down in my stomach to pump everything out to relieve pressure. By the next day things were moving again and after two nights I was back home. 

Due to my mother having Crohn’s and the location of the blockage, my GI doc was convinced it was crohns and the colonoscopy confirmed. I’m still on a long taper off of prednisone - 60mg for two weeks, 50 for two weeks, 40 30 20 10. 

I’ve talked with a nutritionist since then and found a great plan for supplements (fish oil / omega 3, daily multivitamin, sugar free electrolytes, calcium + D) - we talked about reintroduction plan for foods (avoiding all raw veggie, spicy, skins, soda, alcohol since going in)

Here’s what I’ll say for hope, and many address very common questions that I know people come here wondering (me included) and seek validation to not find “the worst”

- since getting “back to normal” after leaving the hospital, I think I’ve had one non solid poop in 7 weeks
- I poop once a day
- I drink coffee with non dairy creamer daily
- prednisone is not a btch for me. I had some achy joints when I was on 60mg but besides that, it’s not affecting me with any other side effects. No moon face. Holding weight. Not breaking out. No mental effects. 
- walking daily is a life saver. Get moving. Get outside.  
- I had my first Skyrizi loading dose about 30 hours ago. It was very easy and I’m having no initial side effects. 

I can’t tell you if skyrizi will work. I can’t tell you I won’t flare. I went from a seemingly normal life to crohns diagnosis pretty fast with no symptoms giving me trouble until the blockage and some dairy sensitivity. 

But overall what I’m finding is this. Everyone in this journey is different. It’s effecting no two people the same. Coming here for validation won’t give it to you. People come here when they’re hurting. I hope I can give you the other side of it. 

Don’t let crohns become you. I keep getting “oh I’m
so sorry” - for me, I’m choosing to remain unbothered and not needing sympathy. Plenty of people have conditions worse than me. Cancers. Alzheimer’s. Maybe your crohns has you down bad right now (or all the time) - maybe like me you’re just starting. Stay strong. Mindset wins. God bless.

373,Skyrizi,New insurance and late on Skyrizi,"Hi! 

I was diagnosed a year ago and have been on Skyrizi which has been working really well for me. About 4 months ago I got new health insurance and when it was time to refill my RX, I couldn’t because I needed a new pre-auth. 

(Important note: I still have the old insurance that covered my Skyrizi, it is just now my secondary insurance, and that’s a whole complicated situation that I wish I wasn’t in in the first place, but I digress) 

I wasn’t quite due yet for my next dose, my OBIs get shipped to me a few weeks in advance, so I just requested a new prior authorization from my gastroenterologist. Wellllll, today rolls around and life has been busy and my calendar alerts me that it’s time for my Skyrizi. 🙃 

I don’t have it. I haven’t heard anything. It’s Friday evening. 

Of course Monday I will be making calls to the specialty pharmacy and insurance but I’m so annoyed because my NOW secondary insurance paid for this medication and it was so easy. 

any tips or advice? I was told by a guy (I’m gonna be so honest I can’t remember where he was calling me from) that I don’t qualify for payment assistance with dual insurance. 

I guess honestly my big rant here is FUCK FOR PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANIES because I had tricare as my primary before and I was very happy with my socialist healthcare and now I had to put my daughter on my workplace healthcare and it is fucking everything up.

I just got officially diagnosed with Crohn's a couple days ago and the doctor wanted me to start treatment asap due to how bad the inflammation in my small intestines is. The hard and scary part is all the treatments the doctor offered me feel impossible. I have a REALLY bad needle phobia and have to be very sedated for blood work, IVs, annual shots, etc. while having the region numbed with a numbing cream. So hearing that the doctor's top suggestion for treatment dealt with injections, scared the absolute daylights out of me. The doctor tried to comfort me by saying that you can't see the needle, but just knowing it is a part of the process had me sobbing and feeling queasy. Even being told that I would have to do frequent blood work to see how the treatment is working terrifies me. I can't do the oral pill treatment either because as of right now, I physically cannot swallow pills (I went to therapy trying to learn and failed badly). 

I would really appreciate it if those who are on Skyrizi could detail what it feels like, or give comparisons. Literally anything about the treatment process that might help me.

I hopped on Skyrizi and it seemed to have worked for almost 2 years. I basically had 0 symptoms and life was great, I was able to leave my house, eat whatever I want and even put on a little bit of weight since I was skin and bones for a lil while. Recently for the past 2 weeks my symptoms seem to have come back. They’re not as strong or as bad as they were prior to treatment but I feel them. Could this mean that I’ve built an immunity to Skyrizi and will have to switch medications? Or is this just a temporary thing and the skyrizi will take back over? I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced the same thing taking skyrizi and what were the next steps. I’m obviously going to talk to my doctors and tell them about this but I just wanted to get your guys opinion also.",2025-10-13 21:10:53,CrohnsDisease,1,1o5wdxd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1o5wdxd/question_about_skyrizi/,2025-10-13
398,Skyrizi,Does anyone use narcolepsy medication for extreme exhaustion?,"I28 F, have struggled with Crohn's for the past 15years.

The exhaustion has got out of control over the past 12years even when i am in remission.
Honestly i am getting desperate for some energy to live my life and enjoy life.

I have tried multiple psychiatrists, cognitive behavioral therapy and anti depression meds.
I have tried and failed alot of biologicals, mtx, azathioprine etc.
Right now i am on Skyrizi and i had resection surgery to remove the infected part.
So changing the meds right now would be bad because i only have one medicine left that i have not tried and fail.

As of right now the Skyrizi works and all infections are gone. However i am still stuck feeling sooo exhausted. Days are a struggle and i cannot work.
I have no attention span and i struggle with memorizing.
Doing anything during the day makes me have to take a nap to somewhat recover.

I honestly hate my life.

I tried asking my doctor for everything i can think of (vitamin infusions, protein infusions, feeding tube, literally anything i can find on reddit/google) but all i get is this ""we don't do that stuff in the Netherlands"" or ""that won't work(for you)"".
It's disheartening to keep hearing no when she and other doctors aren't coming up with other ideas.

So i wondered if anyone uses any stimulant meds like methylfenidaat, modafenil, solriamfetol, pitolisant.
As they can help with exhaustion during the day and also with alertness and memory.

Also i have been to an internist who ruled out other conditions.

She feels like I’m just reacting out of fear and being unreasonable, but honestly I don’t think I’m ready to live alone yet.

422,Skyrizi,Just need to vent for a moment,"I'm finally out of a long flare, the skyrizi is doing it's job. My symptoms are back to ""normal"" minus my daily pain, but guess that's going to be there forever now. Sigh...

Here's the vent: 

I hate how I can be completely terrified of certain things coming back. 

9-10 years ago I had a bad case of erethyma nodosum on both legs (inflammation of the fat layer under your skin, another joyous thing that can happen with crohns). My GI wasn't able to help with it and I saw a rheumatologist who just put me on Prednisone. That did help, but EN is so painful I was miserable until I could get in to the Dr(s) and then wait for the steroid to work. I'm terrified of EN (and vasculitis, but that's a different story).

I've had a sore spot by my ankle for the past week. Felt like a bruise but there wasn't anything visible until a couple days ago when it's now a painful red lump. I had my mom (a nurse practitioner) look at it just in case. She thinks it might just be a bruise, and I hope that's the case, but then it reminded me of EN and now I'm freaked out. Going to keep an eye on things, but I'm getting flash backs of last time I had it and it was similar. 

It sucks to be scared of something that might be coming back. It sucks to fear many things returning, like flares. It sucks knowing that one moment you can be fine and the next you're not.

425,Skyrizi,Confused about switching meds,"Started Skyrizi almost a year ago. I’m not in remission yet but symptoms aren’t bad (mild stomach aches, 2-3 BMs daily, fissure that won’t heal), and fecal cal 600. At the beginning of summer I had a scope and my doctor put me on prednisone since the scope had lots of ulceration, with hopes it would induce remission. Spoiler alert, it didn’t, but my doctor wants me to continue Skyrizi anyways since my symptoms aren’t that bad. His reasoning is that he doesn’t want to burn any bridges trying other meds that don’t work (anti TNFs are already out)

Does this make sense to anyone? Why would we keep trying a med that hasn’t worked after 10 months? I asked if remission was the goal and he kind of gave me a non answer about how my symptoms aren’t that bad. I asked why I should stay on Skyrizi and he said it was ultimately up to me since I’m living with the disease. 

I’m confused as to why he wants me to stay on Skyrizi. I understand that there might not be a ton of options but also it’s not like it’s working and why not try something that could get me into remission? His reasoning doesn’t really make sense to me and it’s frustrating trying to navigate this when he just tells me it’s all up to me.

But since going to skyrizi about 1.5 years ago, I have had a lot more frequent ""IBS"" like symptoms (abdominal cramps, diarrhea, urgency, bloating) than I did prior to getting treatment. I am also more sensitive to certain foods than I was before.

(I'm very grateful to have found a biologic that works on my first try, but the new symptoms are very frustrating and taking a toll on my mental health).

There seems to be a pattern that the IBS symptoms come back as the Skyrizi dose wears off in weeks 4-8 after injection.

The doctor thinks that because I had a clean scope, the correlation between symptoms and dosing schedule is in my head. I asked if the scope told the whole story and he said yes, clean scope = in remission. So maybe it's just a coincidence and the IBS is not related to the Skyrizi. 

However, because I think there is a correlation, he has offered to move to every 4 week dosing if insurance will allow it.

I have been in what I thought was a flare since around January. In December I had a colonoscopy and my doctor told me I had active inflammation and it was time to start a biologic (I had a resection in 2018 and have not been on any meds since then and had minimal issues). 
It took until May to get through insurance issues and start Skyrizi, and during that time my symptoms (diarrhea, bloating, pain) just increased. Even after starting Skyrizi things kept getting worse. The last 3 weeks I’ve had severe pain every time I eat. Diarrhea many times a day. I started mostly liquids about a week ago which does help the pain, but it also resulted in me feeling weak and nauseous and I’ve had a headache for 3 days. 
My GI’s office is a mess right now and they usually take at least a week to respond to me even when I’m telling them how bad I’m doing. I sent them an urgent message a week ago with no response. I called yesterday morning and they said they were waiting for the doctor to review my message. I decided I couldn’t continue much longer like this and walked myself to the ER (I work for the hospital).
My CT showed no narrowing. My CRP is always normal (even right before surgery). They gave me Bentyl in the ER, gave me fluids and potassium bc it was low, and apple juice to raise my low blood sugar. I also had an ultrasound bc I have a history of endometriosis and adenomyosis. They found some kind of unidentified mass in there.

Without me knowing or approving this treatment option, the office did all this work to get my insurance to approve it and signed me up for a savings program. I appreciate that I don't have to go though the whole insurance rigamarole, but I was completely removed from the decision making. 

I didn't know any of this had happened until a nurse called me to schedule infusions. I hadn't even been told it was administered via infusions, so that freaked me out. All of this raised some red flags in my mind. 

Why wasn't this discussed with me at all? Why do they want Skyrizi so bad? Is it really my only option? How do I make an informed decision if no one has explained anything about this disease or treatment with me? Are they being incentived in some way? Idk what to do really.

445,Skyrizi,In the process of getting diagnosed. Started prednisone and it hurrrrtttssss. Anyone else experience this?,"Basically the title. I've been having Crohn's related issues now for two years and it's been a long painful process of getting diagnosed. I'm finally just now getting treatment. I started 20mg of prednisone about a week ago and I've had new sharp, stabby pain and achey-ness since the first day of taking it. Specifically what feels to be my right ovary. CT showed severe inflammation of my terminal ileum and possible fistulization of my bowels to ovary. The sharpness has gone down over the past few days but my abdomen just hurts all the time. Walking more than a couple steps hurts, going up the stairs is painful, just standing up is tough without oxy.

I've talked to my gastroenterologist bc a new sharp pain was scary, and went to the ER got evaluated. They're basically saying the prednisone and eventually skyrizi will do their thing and treat this and I need to wait it out. Once inflammation is down more I go in for a colonoscopy and I guess see if surgery is necessary from there. Which I'm honestly hoping for because I am so uncomfortable and limited in my abilities right now.

I go to a teaching hospital so I’m not doubting how my GI has chose to monitor me but it’s so much less intense than I thought. 

I’m on Skyrizi and doing well since we figured out my dosing needed to be every 6 weeks and not every 8. 

Monitoring consists of blood work every 3 months, calprotectin every 6 months, capsule endoscopy about every 3-4 years.

So for anyone who is on Skyrizi, it's their last hope, and not working: there's still hope for it. Shit just moves at a snails pace. They told me I'd see effects in 3 months and that was bullshit.

Have an appointment in a couple weeks to discuss a new treatment plan. 

I know it’s common to have to try a couple different medications to find the right one, I guess I just got my hopes up that starting fresh from surgery that the Skyrizi would work and would lead me to remission.

For about 2 months, I have been suffering extreme fatigue and muscle weakness. I'm a 38yo male. I can barely get out of bed and will take naps throughout the day. I will occasionally get fatigue like this during a flare, but I have not been having the same bowel symptoms I am used to lately. I'm on skyrizi. I just had blood work done that came back normal. Whenever I eat anything the fatigue gets worse and I get a sour stomach, but no diarrhea.

I've also noticed some nerve pain in my legs. I am type 2 diabetic, but my blood sugar is fine and has been for years. A1c is in non-diabetic range. The pain is sharp pins and needles in my feet and legs, and what I can best describe as if I was standing on a big metal sheet and someone hit it with a sledgehammer. Like intense vibrations up my legs. I've also been having trouble peeing, which I think is possible that it's part of the nerve damage too. 

I'm a school teacher and I'm about to go back after summer break. I'm really worried about going back to work like this. Has anyone had similar symptoms? Any ideas what I might try to alleviate these problems?

458,Skyrizi,Chrons blindsided me,"Context:

I’m a 34 y/o male. Current active duty infantryman serving as a drill sergeant. Outside everyday, peak physical fitness in my life (6 minute mile, 37 minute 5 mile). Wife got a job promotion, all 5 kids in school and doing good. Life is going great.

About 6 years ago I returned from my third deployment as was hospitalized within the week for insane right lower quadrant pain. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 10 and caused vomiting and I couldn’t even stand up. 

Checked for appendix issues, all clear. Hydrated with infusions until pain ceased and sent home. This was a reoccurring thing over the next 6 years. Finally the surgeon in the ER who prepped me for emergency surgery gave me a referral to a GI doc. 

 After testing, it came back that I had extremely high levels of inflammation (all the normal testing) and a CT scan confirmed it was chrons. I was prescribed Skyrizi (not sure about spelling) and referred to a surgeon for his thoughts on needing surgery. 

Fast forward 3 weeks, I’m in the hospital prepped for what was to be a routine resection of less then a foot of my small intestines. Wake up in the hospital with a 6 inch slice through my abs along with 3 small holes around my pelvis / abdomen. 

Turns out I had a series of strictures daisy chained throughout about 2 feet of my small intestines. Doc had to open me up and remove it. 

Been about a week since surgery and I’m getting along better. I’m extremely burned out constantly just doing normal things like going up and down stairs. Couldn’t use the bathroom for 6 days post surgery but a bottle of miralax later and I finally got through it and am currently laid on the bed taking a break between stints in the bathroom. 

Army gave me 30 days off before I’m supposed to return to work but honestly feels like I may need more to recover and be able to perform at any sort of functional level. 

I haven’t started the medication yet but apparently this also has the consequence of my career, after 14 years (6 shy of retirement) being over. Me and the wife just purchased a house. By far the most expensive thing we have ever attempted to buy and now my future just seems so uncertain. 

No real point to the post. Just wanted to share how it affected me. Well is affecting me. Life is crazy. I don’t even understand how something like this happens. One day I’m a machine that can just go go go. Now I can barely walk to the kitchen and back. Crazy stuff.

Hope y’all are out there thriving. I’ll be here just trying to figure out what the hell to do with myself. 🫡",2025-07-29 19:48:08,CrohnsDisease,102,1mcli03,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mcli03/chrons_blindsided_me/,2025-07-29

464,Skyrizi,Scared to start Skyrizi,"Exactly what this says. I’m scared to start Skyrizi.

I have been diagnosed with mild to moderate Crohn’s officially the week of July 4. Atypical onset started in January. I have only a few small ileum ulcers. All 5mm or less. The GI thinks it’s best to get ahead of it now. I was on budesonide, but it only really held my symptoms at bay while I was on it. After about a month off of it, it started advancing again. However, even my symptoms now are still mild-ish GI wise. Only going to the bathroom ~2 times a day (unless I eat a trigger food, usually grease) and they are solid-ish, but they do wake me out of my sleep around 6-7am to start going, and some stomach erythema (very small dots), and some heartburn/GERD. 

It’s the non-GI symptoms that are a bit more wicked as I’m showing more systemic symptoms vs GI. Hair loss, fatigue, bad joint pain (especially the spine and hips), cognitive issues, and some small nerve neuropathy seem to top the list.

She wants to start me on Skyrizi. I’m just scared. I have been healthy for 41 years of my life. Then, out of nowhere in January, all of this hits. Now, I will be on an immunosuppressive drug the rest of life. We are moving and I looked forward to gardening. Now, I’m afraid to do that because I’m afraid of bacterial or fungal infections from working in the dirt. I’m scared to travel anywhere because what if different cuisine and sanitary requirements make me sick? We are supposed to go to DisneyWorld this winter with our 4 year old. What do I do about food the whole time? Do they chlorinate the ride water so I don’t risk infection from it if I accidentally get it on me? While she said the cancer risks with skyrizi are less than the TNFs, I still will have a level of immunocompromise. Told I need to start avoiding certain foods due to risks such as medium rare steaks, feta cheese, sushi, etc. It just makes me so sad and scared. And the getting sicker easier and for longer part? I was always the person getting sicker than anyone else and lasting longer due to my asthma and crappy immune system. So it goes from crappy all my life to now overdrive? This just almost seems like a cruel twist from the universe.

501,Skyrizi,Bad Stick for IVs (Skyrizi Infusions),"I’m on my last dosage of IV Skyrizi and despite hydrating the night before and morning of the infusion, I was poked 4 times and the nurse has clearly just given up and told me to come back next week. I don’t want to screw up my dosage. She claims one week won’t be a huge difference. But I’m just very frustrated. I’ve had Crohn’s for 16 years. I wish that IVs weren’t even a part of this disease. I wish Skyrizi could just be injection only. 

Anyone else have frustrations with getting stuck for IVs or blood work? I’m also a redhead, my veins run, and they blow super easy. I wish I could somehow help this issue I have.

502,Skyrizi,I think I’m failing Skyrizi (rant),"I know this disease has ups and downs but damn this year has been tough. I got diagnosed with IgA vasculitis last year which is potentially a rare effect side effect of anti TNF drugs. This all started a year ago and they took me off Remicade which kept me in remission for nearly 10 years (I’m very lucky in that manner)

Anyways I had a skin biopsy which left a big scar and a kidney biopsy and I now have stage 2 chronic kidney disease. I started flaring in October and had my first loading dose of Skyrizi in early November. I’ve now had 3 OBI injections and my latest fecal cal is over 1000 (highest it’s ever been since I started the tests in 2018). I’ve been on and off entocort since November as well and I’m starting my 3rd leave from work. I’m getting a scope in a few weeks and then my doctor will decide what we’ll do, but I have a feeling the Skyrizi isn’t working considering everything. 

To top it off I got rejected from my dream program a few years ago. One of my work friends said “I just think everything happens for a reason” and if the reason is because my health is in shambles that’s a terrible reason.

Anyways I just needed to rant because it just feels like when it rains it pours. Anyone have ideas of what to do on medical leave because I’m losing my mind.

503,Skyrizi,Who can prescribe biologics? Need to rant...,"I found out a couple of months ago that my prescription was expiring and that it needed to be renewed. 

I called to scheduled an appointment with my GI (not the easiest to work with) and discovered that he has gone private. The clinic that he worked out of never notified me when it happened (a couple of months prior) I cannot get in touch with him directly. Abbvie asked for my GP's info and they reached out to my GP who did not respond. I called my GP and explained the situation. Abbvie asked that he complete this renewal while I wait for a response from my referral for a new GI (who knows when they will call, followup has gone unanswered) My GP said he wasn't comfortable writing it since it was a biologic and would reach out to my GI (since they are well acquainted apparently) and request that he write one last prescription to cover me until I get a new GI. 

Weeks go by and repeated follow ups resulted in ""oh, the GI was on vacation and just got back so I will try to get a hold of him again. I stressed how important it was that I cannot miss or be late on this dose and Skyrizi is the only thing that has recently brought me any relief after being in serious flare mode for the last 4 years. (i just hit one year on Skyrizi and finally feeling human again) I asked my Abbvie gal what to do or if she had any advice and she could only recommend booking an in person appointment and get him to write it in front on me. Ugh. Why is this process so difficult? I just want to be healthy!

So I will be calling tomorrow to beg for a renewal and/or try and get an appointment next week in person......ok rant over. Thank you for listening.

Had the 3 infusions and my first OBI in April. I was feeling pretty good until about 2 weeks ago. Now every time I eat, regardless of what it is, I have severe pain in the same area I had before my surgery where the stricture was. I’ve also been getting more nausea and dizzy spells I’ve never had before. 

I am due for my next Skyrizi on Wednesday. My question, is it possible the Skyrizi isn’t working? Should I wait until after I do this dose and see if I start improving? 

Sorry if this sounds silly, just fairly new to this disease and still trying to figure everything out. I’m still trying to adjust to this disease and accept that I really have it. It’s so frustrating for me to go from being healthy to this.

I’ve been told on here that foods don’t really affect the disease activity, just the symptoms…which I don’t know how to feel. I have to drink tea and coffee daily just to keep awake for my family, but I also blame tea and coffee for my flares.

I’m at a loss for what to do or feel. I can’t live with this crippling fatigue or stress, and Skyrizi seems to take forever to work.

523,Skyrizi,Need advice,"Hi there,


(Sorry for the long post)


I’ll start off by saying that I have had digestive issues for the last 16 years or so.


About 15 ago i was diagnosed with Celiac Disease and went on a gluten free diet. For a few years after that, my symptoms were much better.

In the last 3 years, my condition  worsened and symptoms started to come back.  The only relief I found during those years was immodium. Diarrhea, extreme pain, gas and other symptoms arose and all that lead to my severe crohns diagnosis in may of 2024. 

Between May 2024 and december 2024, I was put on consecutive rounds of tapered prednisone. I did feel relief at higher doses but nothing that made me feel close to normal.

In august 2024, I started skyrizi and did not feel like it had any impact whatsoever.

Imodium was once again the one medication preventing me from getting diarrhea 10 times a day and pain. Days were i did not take it felt extremely painful and were filled with long stretches in the bathroom.


In January 2025 I had a colonoscopy which showed that my gut had healed, even though my symptoms were still present. My calprotectin levels were below 100, at 95 which apparently counts as a normal level.

After discussions with my G.I. In march, she believes skyrizi is working and that my symptoms are due to IBS or another cause. (I have an endoscopy on thursday to investigate)

Since march, my symptoms have worsened significantly on a weekly basis, to a point where I had to go to the E.R. this weekend because of extreme levels of pain. Waited for 8 hours and left because the wait times were too bad and I kept having to go to the bathroom. 

I want to discuss the possibility that skyrizi isnt working for me with my Doctor even if the colonoscopy seemed to say that it was, but I do not know how to bring it up with her. I don’t know how long I can endure the level of symptoms I am currently dealing with and seeing my doctor once every 3 months does not feel like my issues will be solved quickly enough.


Do you guys have any advice for me?

Appreciate you all taking the time to read through my post.

The first one was my first surgery related to crohns, where they took out my appendix and parts of my colon and small intestine, and also hooked up a reversible loop ileostomy. I’ve been on prednisone for about 4 months, and before my first surgery I had 1 skyrizi infusion. After my first surgery, about 2 weeks later I had complications with 2 abscesses forming and I had about 6 infections, possibly from a surgery mishap. Now I’ve been home from my hospital for about 3 weeks, I just got off of a wound vac, and just like before my stomach pain is creeping back slowly. Now I’ve been on skyrizi for 8 weeks about getting my 2 first infusions. I believe my stomach pain is coming back because of my prednisone taper and/ or the skyrizi not working properly. I don’t have a fever so I don’t believe it is an infection. The only thing I can think to do right now is call my GI and ask if I should go back up on my dose of prednisone while we wait and see if the skyrizi is truly working.

After surgery, I naturally felt better, but then started feeling bad again—not as bad as pre-surgery but enough now that it’s draining and I just can’t deal with it.

I can’t tell if this is just the result of having Crohn’s in general (that even with meds, I’ll still feel sick all the time), or if my meds just aren’t working how they’re supposed to and I don’t know that part because I don’t know what Crohn’s pain is like—I’ve, for the better part of my life, only really noticed the partial obstruction pain and other stuff was “no big deal for me” if I was dealing with that—so I don’t know what to expect. Am I supposed to still be feeling drained, this urgency, and like there’s some kind of pit in my stomach that’s not severely painful but just constantly uncomfortable, like I’m sick?

543,Skyrizi,Just can't handle call centre work anymore...,"I've been at my current job for almost 4 years, and in a lot of ways I actually like it. It's work I'm good at anyway... but I got diagnosed with Crohn's at the end of 2023/early 2024 with the onset of a horrible flare. Since then I've had like 7 months of leave collectively, in the hospital twice, and tried (and failed) Remicade. I've been on Skyrizi since January and I've been back to work since February. 

And since February.... I've \_hated\_ my job. Work has tried being accommodating with basically unlimited bathroom breaks, but I can only take bathroom breaks when I'm not on a call. While I'm on a call, the headset feels like a ball and chain keeping me tied down and I can't run if the need hits. Sometimes a call is 5 minutes, but sometimes I'm 2 hours figuring out technical support with a customer and I can't just put them on hold and disappear for the length of time my bathroom attacks sometimes take.   
  
Even though physically I'm \_managing,\_ mentally the stress is getting to me so hard. Every time I'm about to get a phone call I have this horrible stressful sinking feeling and it makes me have to go to the bathroom, so I'm going offline more and it looks like call avoidance, and isn't fair to the rest of my team who wind up getting the calls I've effectively 'dodged.' 

I haven't been given any disciplinary action, but I get in trouble every time I'm even 1 minute late. Every minute of every day is accounted for and micromanaged. I have started missing more work because if I'm going to be late, I feel like I'll be in less trouble for just outright calling out sick. That's also not really fair to my teammates. So even though I'm (kind of) allowed to go to the bathroom as much as I want, the stress and my constant fatigue and everything exacerbates my bathroom needs and I just want to quit. It's also mortifyingly embarrassing every time I have to explain why I'm late, or used an extra extra long break, or anything. Even if I keep it in vague terms, he knows it's all bathroom related and I just can't stand all this. 

I want to quit, but I don't know if mental health/stress that exacerbates my Crohn's would be a good enough 'cause' to leave my job and still get employment insurance while I focus on finding work or making money in a way that really works with my condition. Has anyone here been in a similar position, or how have you handled having to transition out of a job because of Crohns?

546,Skyrizi,In need of some encouragement and advice,"So I got diagnosed almost 3 years ago. Currently on Skyrizi and its been better than Hyrimoz so im pretty happy about that. 

But I still feel so damn drained, weak, and I keep losing weight. 

I work in residential renovations so that definitely contributes to the weight loss. But I have yet to find a solution for the fatigue and brain fog. 

There’s so much im trying to accomplish but I just cant sit and focus. And whenever I do get the focus to sit and work, guess what? I gotta take a dump 😂

Maybe I just need to vent a little but it just feels like so much of my life has been taken from me and im still so young (28M). Im naturally a highly ambitious and driven person, but now I just feel handicapped 

Im feeling pretty stuck and lost

548,Skyrizi,Mom and her sleeping pills,"I originally posted this on r/ostomy, in case some of you already read this:

My mom has had her ileostomy since October of 2024. Ever since, she has been in and out of the hospital due to pain.

We tried to get on Skyrizi, but it was getting difficult to locate an infusion center either because of her insurance or because of the drug assistance program. So, the doctor gave her 2 week sample of Rinvoq. The Rinvoq worked so well for her. But around the same time, she also started Lunesta, a sleeping med.

During her sampling of Rinvoq, she started feeling constipated and there was a bit of blood in her stool. We took her to the hospital. They treated her and recommended Colace (a laxative). We finished sampling the Rinvoq, and my mom was pretty hesitant about that medication. She was continuing the Lunesta because she has difficulties sleeping either because of Crohn's related pain or her mental health conditions.

She goes to the hospital again, where she had to get her stoma revised due to how small it was and stool, when pasty/solid, was having difficulty leaving her body. That's when I decided to take the Lunesta away from her because I feel, since this was a new med for her and she hasn't received her official prescription for Rinvoq yet, this was causing pain or constipation.

After this revision of her ileostomy, she kept begging me for the sleeping pills again. Mind you, she was having a bit of pain due to surgery rather than her usual Crohn's pain or constipation. I decided to give back her Lunesta to see if there truly is a pattern. Lo and behold, mom started having pain again unrelated to her revision.

I know it's a bit of common knowledge that pain pills, sleeping pills, and even psychiatric pills may cause constipation and other abdominal related symptoms. But while googling if Lunesta, again... This medication is newer than any of her psych meds (Seroquel, Mirtazipine, Citalopram), can be problematic for Crohn's.... Nothing pops up???

After this giant background of information, I was wondering if anyone has had trouble with sleeping meds while living with an ostomy due to Crohn's Disease?? Any advice? What sleep meds can help my mom sleep without worsening Crohn's symptoms? Clearly the Rinvoq samples couldn't have caused these symptoms. If it helps, she has been taking some Budesonide to treat her Crohn's because we're still waiting for the specialty pharmacy to receive the provider's prescription for Rinvoq.

549,Skyrizi,Warning: don’t get cutesy with your diet,"This is a cautionary tale about trying new foods. Today I girl bossed a little too close to the sun and paid the price for it. 

So I’m about 6 months into Skyrizi and my insides have been doing fairly ok recently.

I went to a cafe this morning and I decided to branch out and try something new. My Crohn’s restricted diet hasn’t been super “healthy” in a traditional sense or had much variety. Since I’ve been doing ok recently, I thought, why not let’s try something with more fiber to try and get our digestive health back on track. 

This place had wonderful looking açaí bowls full of fresh fruit and granola. I wanted to feel girlypop, so I decided to order one. Stuff like this was a staple in my diet before I got diagnosed with Crohn’s. 

A lot of things will bother my insides right after I eat them, but surprisingly this went down very easily and was actually quite soothing. My stomach felt good and I felt well nourished after my colorful breakfast.

All was going well until I got home after work. Once I had dinner, my digestive tract decided to start doing some more work. 

What wasn’t an issue higher up in the gi tract finally reached my colon. And that is where the bad things happen. The wonderful, fibrous, and colorful fruit and granola decided to get their revenge. 

They must have been upset from being consumed, because they decided to tear up my colon and just fuck up my insides. This resulted in several hours of internal pain and painful bowel movements. 

I guess my hot girl stomach problems aren’t doing as well as I thought, so I might have to rely on some more of my unhealthy low residue choices than I was hoping. 

If you’re not quite in remission and are thinking about branching out, just make sure you are prepared to pay the price. ",2025-04-26 02:54:50,CrohnsDisease,316,1k82ys8,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1k82ys8/warning_dont_get_cutesy_with_your_diet/,2025-04-26

The work part, it’s like I can feel the slight work pressure mess with my stomach bad. I only had to work for five hours, and literally ended up throwing up at the end of my shift. Combined with the stress of work, is just enough to put my body in a very uncomfortable state.

Crohn’s has allowed me to be hyper aware of my body. I’m feeling better now, but man was today super symptomatic.

Diagnosed a year ago, having symptoms for a year before that. Been on that skyrizz for 9 months, and my labs were definitely showing improvement as of October. I was generally feeling better too, getting a lot of energy back and general abdominal pain decreasing a lot. 

But then since January or so I’ve felt like I’ve been in a constant moderate flair. Bm patterns all over the place and abdominal pain is near constant. My energy levels have seemed okay, so I’ve been holding on to that silver lining (I work out and compete a bit in weight lifting, so that’s been my gauge). 

Anyway, I finally had my first colonoscopy after skyrizi and it was not good. I scored worse than pre-treatment. I’m super conflicted with myself and my ability to ignore my abdominal pain (“it’s fine, the meds are working I’m sure, healing takes time, I’m too busy to worry about this”).

I (27M) was recently diagnosed with Crohn's. I had a laproscopic small bowel resection and start my first Skyrizi infusion tomorrow.

  
I'm also a software engineer and want to make something to help people with IBD. I would like to get feedback from other IBD patients.

  
I have a lot of big ideas for things to make but it's best to start small and build working prototypes quickly. My first idea was to make a simple tracker / log for infusions that includes things like:

  
\-Tracking dates for infusions + reminders

\-Tracking specific location of the infusion on your body

\-Infusion type (medicine, loading infusion vs. pen vs. OBI)

\-Adverse reactions or affects

\-Customizable notes

\-Timer for waiting for the biologic to heat up when taken out of the fridge

  
Would this be useful to you? I would like to make it a website (that's mobile-friendly) instead of a mobile app since it is faster. Are there other feature requests, specific to infusion tracking, that you would find beneficial?

587,Skyrizi,Cannot Stand Calling Ins and Pharmacies,"I am very incredibly fortunate to have meds that work for me and I'm on Skyrizi currently, so I can live normally which I am so grateful for. Getting these meds, however, is the biggest pain in the ass on the planet and phone calls with insurance and the pharmacies and its actually driving me crazy. 

I graduated recently and had to change insurance plans to my mom's and its just been such a nightmare to deal with call centers at specialty pharmacies and insurance companies. I had to make about 10 phone calls today and the time I was on the phone totalled 3 hours for something I expected to take 30 mins max. I was sobbing by the end because I just can't stand how bureaucratic and awful it is. 

Every call is like 3 automated menus where they refuse to let you speak to an agent for at least 10 mins of navigating menus. Then most agents have no clue what's going on and tell me to call other people who tell me to call other people, and I end up playing phone tag for hours. They also use weird insurance language that makes no sense on purpose and then say they aren't allowed to give you info that as a patient you should get (for example: the criteria for prior authorization, the amount my copay card covers of the 1000s of dollars insurance doesn't cover, etc). Then they have to read out monologues about data privacy, surveys, etc that just waste time, not to mention the automated menu voices speak sooo slowly and include information of such little relevance (""did you know?.... blah blah""). Then of the human callers, half speak english so poorly or have such poor connection you can't understand a thing. 

I try so hard to be patient, but I actually cannot take it. Sometimes I just start crying or get really curt and angry. It feels like I have to hurdle this horrible obstacle every time I have to order my meds and I just can't take it, anyone else feel the same or have advice? I feel like a horrible human being after I’m done with these calls because they make me so mad, but it really feels like an incredibly important thing for me is being put in incredibly incompetent hands, and it is so painful to deal with.

598,Skyrizi,anyone else experienced this? (skyrizi),"Im about 9 months in of being on skyrizi, and the first 6 months or so I only got sick a couple of times, it was bad but was not frequent. these past couple of months ive gotten a bad upper respiratory infection 3 times now. (viral or not I do not know but I work around a lot of people) 
I also lost 10-15 pounds rather quickly (fluctuating now) after being at a steady weight for almost a year waiting to be medicated. 
I also feel like my health is deteriorating, ive dealt with fatigue, muscle weakness, now gallbladder issues, constipation, hair falling put more, bruising easily, pain in my feet and back, and overall just a low capacity of energy to do anything physical. I feel like I have a small battery of energy and it does not refill enough to last me a whole day of work from one night of sleep. 
I will say I was already dealing with muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, constipation, and and random body pain before I started skyrizi. but I feel like my bad days have become worse and more frequent and more issues with my health are popping up. I also found out I have 20ppm methane SIBO. 

My GI who is does not seem to give a lot of thought to my situation, said we could switch biologics. but I dont feel like a lot of symptoms are from skyrizi, I feel like theres something else going on in my body and my immune system being compromised is making it worse. My last scope confirmed that my inflammation has gone down, but im not in remission. I believe I have a mild/moderate case of crohns. I dont want to switch if its working to take the inflammation down, and restart the whole process of taking a biologic esp when biologics all work to suppress your immune system and skyrizi is known to be one of the ones with less side effects. 


but Im honestly becoming concerned; scared I could have cancer or something. especially bc im bruising so easily now and ive never had that happen before, big bruises from minor bumps into things, dark circles under my eyes, hair falling out. getting sick more often. I get so tired after work it causes me anxiety. Only other thing I can think that could cause this is a prolonged nutrient deficiency, im not anemic but I do have iron and vit D deficiency confirmed",2025-02-28 15:57:05,CrohnsDisease,1,1j0axur,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1j0axur/anyone_else_experienced_this_skyrizi/,2025-02-28
599,Skyrizi,Is frequent urination a symptom or side effect?,"Diagnosed over a decade ago so I’m very familiar with my flares and “normal” symptoms. 

I started odansetron and dicyclomine a week and a half ago and no joke have been going to the bathroom to pee every 30 minutes. And for whatever reason I seem to be slightly constipated as I’ve been having a bowel movement every few days instead of the usual 6-12 times a day. This could definitely be a sign of the meds working but it was to target my nausea and cramping so idk. 

Is it worth bringing up to my gastro that I’ve been having super frequent urination? I also start Skyrizi tomorrow so I’ll be seeing my gastro soon anyway.

600,Skyrizi,How do you know when you fail a biologic? Vs flare?,"Hi! I’m a little confused right now and just curious what others have experienced with treatment while on biologics. I was diagnosed with mild Crohn’s around Nov 2023 after elevated calprotectin, bowel wall inflammation on CT, and visual inflammation/ulcers on Colonoscopy but oddly biopsy negative. I was started on budesonide which brought my fecal calprotectin down some but still elevated, and then was eventually put on Skyrizi after insurance approved starting Apr 2024. My symptoms did get better but not 100% and my calprotectin went into normal range by Oct 2024. My symptoms started to come back here and there and even more so by end of 2024 so we did a repeat colonoscopy Dec 2024 which biopsies showed chronic inflammation with active inflammation. We just did a repeat calprotectin last week which is now only mildly elevated at 106. So….do I assume Skyrizi is not working or a small flare? What has been the deciding factor for others where they decided to change your biologic vs maybe a course of steroids to continue to see if the biologic is working?

Or if over time my stomach will slowly adapt a little more as i gradually keep introducing. 

I want to keep trying with fiber as a few dietitians I’ve seen for crohns say it’s important to include fiber as it helps you stay in remission according to studies. My dietitians also seem to think I’ll be able to eat normal with more time. Has anyone experienced this like getting better with time even past the “given” biologic time frame ?

My GI in July was only able to go 15cm on the colonoscopy, as well as earlier this month on February 10th which I’ve found surprising; because I was literally bedridden for a few months until I got on the Rinvoq. 

I also use weed (cbd/g gummies are amazing) and kratom (in super moderation) as a way to help manage.

However, I’ve received some recent MRI results and they said ‘This shows an improvement disease severity but the same 40 cm of disease have been noted.’

This is my fourth biologic. I don’t really want to switch yet especially as I feel mostly ok, but conscious it hasn’t technically ‘worked’. I’d love to know if anyone reached remission later with the same med, or has seen success with a similar story to me?

613,Rinvoq,Rinvoq side effect?,"I’m about half way through my loading dose and I have been feeling great! Sometimes my tummy feels off when I eat too much dairy for multiple days but for the first time, I seem to be able to recover from my bad choices. I have so much energy and I no longer feel nauseous when I eat or feel terrible after a BM. 

One of my known Crohn’s symptoms is inflammation in my gums and canker sores that don’t heal quickly. Well, recently the part of my mouth where my upper lip touches my gums of my top teeth are super swollen, almost like I burned it with hot soup. At first I was worried that I am returning to a flare, but I still feel great so I’m starting to worry that something else is going on. So far, this has been going on for just over a week and I’ve started to do salt rinses that seems to temporarily make it feel better but nothing has really changed if not slowly getting worse.

620,Rinvoq,rinvoq and fat distribution??,"Went on rinvoq about 2 months ago, was on steroids for about 6 weeks as well. I was about 7kg under my normal weight before then after a bad flare. 

I’m now back up to my previous weight but my body feels completely different, with way more of my body fat in my fupa. I don’t have any issues with the weight gain, i’m just finding sitting down uncomfortable with my pants. 

I’ve been eating probably more than i should do, as my steroid appetite hasn’t left me even though it’s been weeks - but i haven’t gained weight for the last 2 weeks despite eating a lot. Can your fat move around without gaining weight?

Did anyone else notice their body fat moving while in rinvoq? or is this more of a steroid thing? I’m also pretty young so it could be hormones. I’m hoping it’s temporary because i don’t particularly feel like having to lose weight or work out harder.

I have so many side effects from Rinvoq - severe acne and folliculitis that required accutane but has persisted, elevated cholesterol, weight gain, severe constipation (~1 or BMS a week even with miralax, senna, and magnesium), and of course compromised immune system resulting in shingles, ringworm, and slow healing wounds. 
When are the side effects bad enough to warrant switching meds? I like the convenience of an oral treatment and technically my Crohn’s is controlled, but the side effects are miserable.

634,Rinvoq,Elective Surgery - A decision I have to make,"Hi - I am a 34yo M living in the UK. I was diagnosed with severe crohns disease back in May 2019. It started with uncontrollable and rapidly worsening diarrhea. I was passing a lot of blood and ended up losing 2-3 stone in 1 month before I was hospitalised. I've been through 5 medications/courses of treatments since then and countless courses of steroids. I've had a few long term bad flare ups and another hospitalisation in between.

Jan 2025 was my last flare up and at that time I elected to have a subtotal colectomy (where they remove the entire large colon but leave the anus). I was at a real low point at this time which was why I wanted the surgery.

I had started rinvoq a few weeks before and put off surgery until after the summer to give the medication time to kick in and to give me a chance at having a normal quality of life. 

The medication seems to be working. I feel pretty good, I can do what I want and when I want and eat what i want, and apart from the side effects of meds everything seems to be pre- crohns. 

However now I am having cold feet about my surgery which I need to make a decision about. I recently had a colonoscopy to give me a medical standpoint to make a decision from - I didn't want to proceed to do something irreversible without all the evidence. I was hoping this would come back as my IBD in remission but the surgeon stated there was still inflammation and ulceration and recommended I go ahead with the surgery.

I still feel well and am completely lost about what to do next. I have a good job with 6 months full sick pay and a very loving and caring partner. Having the time off to recover isn't a problem and i am very lucky to be in this position. 

My worry is that I am choosing to make my life a lot worse for an unknown amount of time for something that could be avoided.

I've read that IBD patients who have persistent symptoms are more likely to have complications such as bowel cancer and blockages - and after being on medication for 9 months I am still not in remission so my health can be pushed over the edge at a moments notice. On paper surgery seems like a smart pro - active move.

Tldr: crohns disease, surgery a very near and logical option, surgery recommended by surgeon, good position to have surgery, but feeling very well and very lost about whether to go ahead.

I just need someone to talk to who's been in a similar situation.",2025-09-22 17:31:05,CrohnsDisease,4,1nnswe5,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nnswe5/elective_surgery_a_decision_i_have_to_make/,2025-09-22
635,Rinvoq,my rinvoq JAKne before and after - to hopefully help someone.,"https://imgur.com/a/KpCEAoi progress pics of my face

i started rinvoq dec 2024. im on 15mg but will be upped to 30mg. im not concerned about it reappearing, as i was on 45 and dropped to 15 and the acne didn’t increase or decrease from dosage.

first slide is may 2025. this is when the acne peaked and i realized it was not calming down. i was getting 40+ whiteheads every morning. washing my face 3x a day. trying every skincare product i could find that was “acne fighting”. nothing worked.

i went to a dermatologist who gave me clindamycin and tretinoin. my routine was this:

AM - gentle cleanser and liberal clindamycin. avoid sun exposure all day as clindamycin and retinol cause skin to burn easily.

PM - 4% benzoyl peroxide cleanser and tretinoin. train skin over time to be able to use tretinoin EVERY night. you will see the most results this way.

after 3 months, i have gotten down to:

AM - gentle cleanser and dry skin moisturizer, my psoriasis has come back from the season change and low rinvoq dosage. clindamycin on days i notice i wake up with a few extra pimples (hormonal or ate something greasy), use as a localized spot treatment

PM - gentle cleanser, glycolic acid toner (exfoliant and cleans out sebum in pores. helps my psoriasis while clearing blackheads and little cystic acne spots), liberally apply tretinoin, no moisturizer

good luck and pleeease dm me if u need advice! or support! im not kidding this acne DESTROYED my confidence i wouldnt leave the house. i became so agoraphobic and felt like everyone was staring. it will get better

It’s always, “this med didn’t work, let’s try another.”

I was on Inflectra, which failed, then moved to Rinvoq and things actually seemed better. My inflammation went down and my calprotectin was finally in a normal range. But despite that, I still developed a fistula and an abscess, and now I’m scheduled for surgery next month.

The part that really worries me is that every medication seems to fix one thing but eventually causes another set of issues. It’s like we’re just trading problems instead of addressing the root cause. That’s why, after surgery, I’ve decided to try going the natural route.

684,Rinvoq,Anyone able to maintain remission on 15mg Rinvoq?,"Hello! I've been on Rinvoq for over a year now and it's been a miracle. It was finally really starting to kick in at the end of the 12 week loading dose of 45mg, I was nervous to lower my dose at the time but I continued to improve on 30mg and have felt amazing ever since. A couple months ago my doctor confirmed i'm almost certainly in remission for the first time ever (yay!) with blood work and a stool sample, but we'll also be doing my yearly colonoscopy sometime later this year to be 100% sure. I asked if it would ever be a possibility for me to try to move down to 15mg, and he said he usually keeps patients on 30mg but he'd be willing to consider it if my colonoscopy comes back clear. I'm mostly just interested in moving down to 15mg because I have a lot of anxiety around potential severe side effects, and also hope to further minimize my acne which is my only current side effect. That being said, I'm unsure myself if 15mg would be a good move. I'd hate to ruin my progress.

Is anyone here on 15mg and doing well? Or had to move back up to 30mg after trying 15mg?",2025-06-10 14:04:33,CrohnsDisease,3,1l7zkwn,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l7zkwn/anyone_able_to_maintain_remission_on_15mg_rinvoq/,2025-06-10
689,Rinvoq,Post colonoscopy issues,"So I had an upper and lower scope Thursday. Previous to my scope my flare has been pretty bad but I’ve noticed things are worse now. I can’t lift things without having a mild accident, urgency is more intense, and the pains have intensified. It’s been a struggle at work even lifting light things or bending over. I’ve had to use depends and I absolutely hate it because I get irritation. I was wondering if anyone felt worse after a scope. I go back to GI Thursday thankfully. I’m on Rinvoq 30mg. I was doing great at 45mg but once I was dropped the flare returned. My doctor is thankfully supposed to up it back to 45mg. This is just frustrating. I have a meeting with HR at my work Tuesday to give them documentation about my crohns; not sure what the meeting exactly entails but I hope it’s just accommodations. I have to pretty much just get through work the best I can because I’m still in the 90 day probation period and I don’t really have anyone to cover me. I’ve only called off once during my initial training and left early Friday because I felt so terrible. They seem to be understanding as I told them when I started I have crohns but I’m not going to hold my breath. They are also suddenly giving me more hours which is rough on my body but I need the money. 

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just hate this disease so much. ",2025-06-01 01:44:53,CrohnsDisease,5,1l0dbj5,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l0dbj5/post_colonoscopy_issues/,2025-06-01
691,Rinvoq,"Gastro Dismissal: If this isn’t a flare, then what is it?","
Hey all,

I just had a recent appointment with my gastroenterologist. Usually, they go okay, but this time I walked out feeling unheard and dismissed tbh. 

I don’t use the word flare lightly. If I called everything a flare, I’d basically be in a constant one. So when I do say I’m flaring, I mean something specific:

	•	Intense abdominal pain, typically under my ribcage, that radiates to my back
	•	Extreme bloating, like there’s trapped gas I can’t release. no gas, no bowel movements during these episodes
	•	These attacks last at least 15 hours, usually 24, and have gone up to 48 hours
	•	If I can pass gas, it’s painful and only comes out in short, sharp “pops”
	•	The only other way my body releases anything during these episodes is through vomiting

Once the worst of the pain passes, I swing back into diarrhoea, which is my baseline outside these attacks. But during the appointment, my gastro told me this isn’t a flare, because apparently a flare has to include diarrhoea during the cramping.

That really threw me. Because what I described above feels exactly like a flare (or what do I even call it?) 
It’s debilitating, disruptive, and recurring.


To add more context, I recently switched from Infliximab to Rinvoq. I’ve definitely noticed some changes, mainly with bowel movements. Lately, I’ve been dealing with intense constipation, which is completely new for me. My gastro told me that means the Rinvoq is working and that constipation is just my “normal” stool consistency and it’s gone to my old/baseline habits. 

But I’ve never had constipation as a regular symptom. And yes, while I am constipated at times now, it quickly flips back to diarrhoea. 
It’s a mixed bag, but mostly still loose stools &amp; diarrhoea. 

(I am on Diamox 1000mg so this can actually be the reason of my constipation, which I informed my Gastro of this new medication prescribed from my Neurologist &amp; Ophthalmologist)  



On top of that, I also have both IBD and IBS, and I’ve already worked hard to identify my trigger foods. I’ve been avoiding them as much as possible, and it does help, but I still get these severe “flare-like” attacks even when I haven’t eaten anything problematic.

A dietician recommended doing a strict low FODMAP diet, but honestly, I’ve already adapted parts of it into my lifestyle as much as I can especially with limited time, money, and cooking for others. Going fully low FODMAP feels almost impossible. (Like seriously? no garlic or onions? Broccolini but only the stem, not the florets? Where’s the flavor? and that’s not even all the eliminations lol) 

So yeah, I’m kind of at a loss. I’ve been experiencing this severe pain for years, even before my Crohn’s diagnosis. And now it feels like I’m being told to just live with it. I don’t even know what to call it anymore. If it’s not a flare, then what is it? And there’s nothing I can take to fix it. It’s not something I can sleep off because it wakes me up in pain.

I’m still not in remission and honestly, I feel like Rinvoq hasn’t “fixed” anything though it has only been 4 months so i’ll wait and see. But according to my gastro, it’s working fine and this is just how things are now?

If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms or has any thoughts, especially on what to actually call this or how to advocate for myself better. 
I’d really appreciate it, sorry for the long rant/if you even got this far. ",2025-05-31 06:58:45,CrohnsDisease,9,1kzqvbf,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kzqvbf/gastro_dismissal_if_this_isnt_a_flare_then_what/,2025-05-31

713,Rinvoq,Any advice? Don’t know where else to turn,"Hello all! I’m fairly new to reddit and wish I had signed up years ago - after lurking through here for awhile I decided to ask your guy’s advice / opinion on a situation I’ve been dealing with for the last few months 

So my Chrons journey has been long, frustrating and exhausting. Maybe I’ll post a rant to just vent one of these days but for now I’ll give you only critical details. I was diagnosed when I was in the 4th grade and I’m 31 now. I’ve been through the wringer and been on every medication, but as it stands now I’m taking Rinvoq and I’m starting to taper down on Budesonide, down to 6mg daily.
I’ve had multiple resections and had an ileostomy  from 2014 to 2016.

Anyway, for the last few months I’ve been having this issue of defecating in my sleep - it started as a little and now it can be up to 3 times a night and it’s totally random - doesn’t feel like it matters what I’m eating or anything. Obviously this situation is giving me insane anxiety, after working long hours and desperately wanting to relax - and especially since I am a single dude who sometimes will have a lady over for the night - that’s my worst fear 😅

So my question I suppose is - does anyone know of any medication, prescriptions or over the counter that could potentially slow my digestion down or something to lower the risk of this happening? Or any advice in general? I tell my doctor about it and the story is always the same and he just tells me to carry on as is. They want me to get another ileostomy - but I refuse. I commend anyone who has one and has learned to live with it and have their quality of life improve but the years I had mine were the darkest I’ve ever had and I just can’t go through that again",2025-04-09 17:39:38,CrohnsDisease,5,1jvbs3a,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jvbs3a/any_advice_dont_know_where_else_to_turn/,2025-04-09

1,Humira,Just had a colonoscopy today and am being asked to go in for another in 2 weeks.,"I (29F) was diagnosed in 2008 and have been on many different drugs for it over the years. I had a bowel resection in 2016 after a bowel perforation and pretty severe strictures. I had a pretty bad flare at the start of this year. I got a colonoscopy in January and they found pretty severe disease. My doctors stretched the anastomosis at my surgical site and changed me from Humira to stelara. I also started LDN around this time. I went in for a repeat colonoscopy in October after not having any digestive symptoms but was having some severe joint issues related to the Crohn’s. He couldn’t get the scope through the anastomosis and said either surgery or repeat the colonoscopy to try stretching it. I also started budesonide at this time and a pre-auth to start taking stelara every 4 weeks instead of 8 which I will have my first 4 week dose in a couple weeks. I went for the repeat scope to avoid surgery and am now home after that procedure. He was able to stretch it about 13mm but still couldn’t get the scope through it and is now recommending I go in for another one in 2 weeks. Idk but 4 colonoscopies in a year feels a little excessive to me. He also is recommending I start taking miralax every day for god knows why (I don’t really plan on doing this, I have enough diarrhea as it is). I plan on reaching out to the office with some follow-up questions after I get some rest but I wanted to get some insight. I’m going to have to get a repeat scope done in 6 months anyway to check how the medication is doing, should I just wait until then? Do I just go for the repeat and see if he can stretch it more? He said there’s always a chance it will close up again. It just feels like the stricture isn’t really my main problem. I had an MRI done in October that showed disease throughout my small bowel so it seems like inflammation is more of the issue here. It’s been 10 years since the surgery and this isn’t the first time they couldn’t get the scope through but this is the first time anyone has cared to do something about it. Sorry if I’m missing any context I did just home out of anesthesia like an hour ago.

Edit: I feel like it’s worth noting that he said it was up to me if I got the repeat colonoscopy or not depending on how I feel after this one. But idk how I’m supposed to tell a difference if I wasn’t having digestive symptoms to begin with.

30,Humira,The pendulum swing is just wild. (Question about infusion frequency),"I started receiving Avsola (infliximab biosimilar) infusions earlier this year and have just hit my maintenance dose (100mg every 8 weeks). When I switched from 2 to 4 weeks between infusions I could tell I was starting to go downhill symptom-wise before my infusion. This last stretch between infusions landed me in surgery with a full-blown perianal abscess and fistula that ended up with a seton. I also lost 8lbs in a couple of weeks and couldn't eat anything other than eggs and maybe bread. I met with my surgeon to discuss a diverting loop ostomy and possible resection. Got a CT scan and some bloodwork. Went in for my infusion and the same day experienced relief that has lasted and increased. 

Through no fault or decision of my own I'm in between GI specialists until mid-November. Before my previous specialist left the practice I had raised the concern that I might need a different dose of Avsola. How often do you go in for infusions?

  
I've been on Humira and Rinvoq and with those two drugs I was fine on the loading doses but would end up in a way, way worse physical place on the maintenance dose than I had been before even starting the drugs in the first place.

I’ve had this problem since I started taking Humira (adalimumab) so for about two years now.

I’ve read other similar posts, and I think it could be drug-induced psoriasis. I’m just worried it might spread or develop into something worse in the future, but for now, it’s only been on my legs. Is this something worth changing biologics for?

32,Humira,CT Scan with Breeza?,"Hi y’all, so I (27f) had a CT scan with oral and IV contrast today. My GI ordered one because they couldn’t get a scope past narrowing in my sigmoid colon. I’ve been on prednisone since August (nearing the end of my taper, had to restart and slow down after my scope) and started Humira last week. 

Normally when I’ve had CTs with oral contrast in the past, I drank barium (bleh). But today they had me drink Breeza (3 bottles) The scan itself went well and besides the sigmoid and descending colon, everything else thankfully looked okay. 

However, I’ve been running to the bathroom every 20 minutes since I got home. I barely made it in the house. Really upset because I was finally having solid stools for the first time in a year. I don’t know if I should’ve asked for less to drink because I’ve had resections and barely staying at 99 pounds right now. 

Is this common with this contrast type? And if so, how long did it last for you? ",2025-10-13 20:56:45,CrohnsDisease,6,1o5w012,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1o5w012/ct_scan_with_breeza/,2025-10-13
33,Humira,Dr. wants me on Biologics - not sure what to start on,"I've had mild to moderate Crohn's for a bit now - worse now, only a few years detected and I do yearly scopes. I'm on Mezavant and even though my fecal calprotectin went down from high 350s ug/g to under 30 ug/g the scope results show a lot of small ulcers that appearing in my large intestines more and more after each year and isn't healing up. I have other problems too but for the most part I've been able to manage it.

Since my situation hasn't improved and the ulcers are getting worse my Dr. wants me on Biologics right away and I have some options to pick from, just not sure which to start with. There is some concern that my insurance and coverage here might force me to take Biosimilars and I have no idea how that factors into the effectiveness.

So far I've been given the options of:

1. Stelara  
2. Remicade  
3. Humira  
4. Upadacitinib

My Dr. didn't say there was any cancer concerns, and the only issue was that if I was to take Upadacitinib it would cause a acne, potential blood clots, and maybe shingles.

The paper I have does say there is risk with biologics for heart failure and lymphoma, but it is extremely rare.

I have to do a few tests anyways before I can get on any of these as there are certain limitations if I have TB and HBV.

41,Humira,Mild symptoms return 2 weeks before Skyrizi OBI?,"I started Skyrizi earlier this year and felt great during the infusions. I have had two OBIs with my third due next week, and I noticed that usually I feel a little worse before the next dose. This time around the shift is definitely really noticeable. 

Symptoms wise it's still pretty mild, just slightly more urgency/frequency and looser stools and gas but minimal pain. I previously took Humira and would sometimes have the same a couple days before my next dose but not every time.

I also have mast cell issues (the cell that signals your body to go into anaphylaxis malfunctions or misfires) and doctors suspect that the autoimmune irregularity and inflammation my crohn's is the main trigger for that. So I am also more reactive leading up to my next OBI in that regard, so on top of more uncomfy GI symptoms I am more symptomatic to perfumes, my cat, food, etc.

I'm due for a colonoscopy next year, but I didn't know if having mild symptoms was enough to push for escalating to a 6 week dose or having an infusion booster to try and help.

I just went to refill my Hyrimoz for the first time and realized that Accredo wanted me to get on Cyltezo… I called my doctor and asked them what was going on and they regrettably informed me that Accredo is no longer making or manufacturing Hyrimoz and my insurance will not let me use any other specialty pharmacy besides Accredo.

55,Humira,Experiences with the UK NHS for potential Aussie expat,"Hi fellow Crohnie's.

  
I'm an Australian living in Brisbane with Fistulizing Crohn's disease. I am very lucky that my condition is well-managed through Humira and that I enjoy an excellent public health system. I am also fortunate to be able to afford private health care when the wait times for public health services are too long/I want to see a private specialist. 

I have thought on and off about moving to London for a year or two as I am eligible for an ancestry visa. I have also read the eligibility rules for this visa and health conditions are not mentioned (hooray!)  However, until I started on Humira I wasn't well-enough to make the move and set myself up in a foreign country. Luckily, I am now in a much healthier place and able to think about my future goals. 

As well as the availability of a visa, the UK is appealing to me due to the NHS. However, I have read that the NHS is struggling and would appreciate people's views as to quality and availability of public gastroenterology. This, as well as the cost of Humira in the UK, will be important for me to consider as I decide whether to make the move, or not.

My child (12) is starting on Humira (a bio similar) tomorrow. It'll be two injections (unfortunately- syringe- as she doesn't weigh enough yet for the pen).  

Asking for:  

1. A practical answer to this: The nurse said she could be physically active afterwards and the next day.  (Intense volleyball &amp; dance) Anyone have a different perspective on this?  

2. Words of encouragement and/or tips for her!!  She's pretty sad about the whole thing, so anything to lift her spirits would be great!  

(For anyone not following along and curious, we went with humira over remicade because medically, they were both fine for her situation. And psychologically, she didn't want the infusion/hospital piece ongoing, and it felt fine to do every other week with the pen.  We were not anticipating having to use an actual syringe though, as the doctor gave us misinformation at first, and we thought it would be the easypen.  But, we're staying the course, and hoping for the best!)

61,Humira,"Doc recommends biologic, been over 20 years since last treatment","I was diagnosed in 2000 and rode a rollercoaster of Prednisone, Pentasa, Asacol, Azathioprine, and got a 10cm resection in my ileum in 2003. I managed to get my symptoms under control well enough that I opted out of treatment despite the doc recommending maintenance drugs. Had a doc recommend Entocort EC after a 2016 colonoscopy showed active Crohn's but I declined because meds were over $300/mo and my symptoms felt manageable.

Fast forward to my most recent colonoscopy today and my doc found several small ulcers, strictures, and a small polyp in my lower colon and ordered an ultrasound to look at my small intestines. I guess it's time I get this under control! 

He mentioned wanting to start me on a biologic like Humira or Remicade and I was honestly surprised he didn't mention any of the newer medications like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, or Entyvio. I called my insurance and I can't get pricing for any of those drugs til the specialty pharmacy re-opens tomorrow, but that has me a little worried. I have Presbyterian and am in the US with a state employee plan.

Curious what folks who've been on Humira or Remicade have experienced? Have you moved off those drugs to any of the newer ones? Had visible repair of the intestines? Has treatment cost a fortune?

Right now, my symptoms are mild and fairly manageable. My GI recommended that I continue monitoring my condition with calprotectin tests, blood work, and colonoscopies once or twice a year. Still, I’m worried that if I don’t start treatment soon, my condition could suddenly get worse.

I’m unsure whether I should begin **Infliximab** now or wait a couple of years. Could you explain the potential side effects? Should I ask my doctor about starting Infliximab, or is it better to hold off for now?

On top of that, I recently started going to the gym (about three weeks ago) and have been eating more to support my workouts. Could increasing my food intake make my symptoms worse (like diarrhea or flares)? Would it be smarter to just stay in shape without trying to bulk up so I don’t put extra stress on my intestines?

It’s sharp deep pain above my belly button and on both sides. Sometimes I can’t even talk when it hits. My stomach feels full of air or pressure like bubbles moving around. I haven’t eaten in over a day and still feel bloated and sick. I even have to arch my back to get relief. It’s brutal.

The fistula keeps coming back too. It goes away for a bit and then shows up again. I can feel it starting up now and I know what’s coming. It’s exhausting.

Looking back I’ve felt like this in some way most of my life. Always bloated. Had to suck in my stomach even when I was in shape. Constant brain fog. Bathroom issues. I thought I was just lazy or dumb growing up. Now I know I was just sick.

I had a calprotectin test in April, and it was in the 300s.    That's pretty good for me - it had been as high as 800 before, about six years ago, when I was first diagnosed.   It's normally been in the 200-300 range since then.   

It was retested this week, and jumped to 1400!    I started Skyrizzi in June (after failing Stelara and Humira), so that's one change since my last test.    I also have been trying to cut back on Advil, so I've been taking Tylenol (usually 2 500mg capsules per day).

My diet hasn't been the greatest the past few months - I've definitely slipped some there.  

I also have early stage PSC, but I've been on ursodiol for that since last October, so I don't think that would be a change that would have contributed to this huge spike in calprotectin.

97,Humira,What to expect when starting biologics,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with mild Crohn’s a few months ago. After failing budesonide twice, my doctor put me on Humira. I know it’s quite early, but it’s been almost 4 weeks since I started. At first, my symptoms were low for about 2-3 weeks (even tho first week transition between budesonide and Humira was a lil unstable it was still ok), which felt really good.

However, during this 4th week, some symptoms have come back such as cramps, irregular stools, going to the toilet 5-6 times a day, sometimes mucus, but no blood so far.  
I’m wondering if anyone else experienced something similar at the beginning of Humira, and how long it took before things stabilized (or not lol)?

This up-and-down is really frustrating because one day you feel good and the next it’s chaos again. It’s so tiring not to have stability, honestly.

98,Humira,Anyone w. Constipation? Crohn’s decided diarrhea was too basic.,"Hi guys,

So I have been diagnosed with Crohns and Psoriasis arthritis (yey lucky me) June this year. I am pretty new to all of this, so I don’t know if this is something normal of the disease, but I get very often periods of really strong and painful constipation. At first I thought it was “normal”, but by reading this sub I noticed everyone else suffers the complete opposite, diarrhoea and frequent bowel movements. I do also have that of course, but I am starting to wonder why this constipation comes up so often. I haven’t changed my diet, water intake, anything. Anyone with the same issue?

I am currently being treated with Humira without success, and probably soon will be changed to Remicade. 

Thanks a lot",2025-08-08 11:15:48,CrohnsDisease,30,1mksf0l,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mksf0l/anyone_w_constipation_crohns_decided_diarrhea_was/,2025-08-08
99,Humira,Random Allergic reaction?,"Hey everyone,

So I am just getting back from the ER due what they are saying an allergic reaction to Humira. Thing is, I have been taking Humira since late October and this is the first time I had a reaction and it was BAD. 

Started off with abdominal cramps that wouldn't go away, then went to chest pains, then back pain, then started sweating like crazy and when it got to the point of shortness of breath, I knew something was wrong (and that is rare for someone as hard headed as me). 

They gave me prednisone which helped a bit but it was only when I orally evacuated my stomach did I start to feel any relief. The only thing that was freed was the peach I ate right before I took the humira which was 3hrs after I ate anything prior. Everything else I ate during the day seemed to stay down.The allergic reaction started about an hour after taking the dose, so they feel pretty sure it was the Humira. 

Has this ever happened to anyone else? Can you really just develop an allergy to a medication you have been taking for months out of the blue or should I investigate this a little more? 

Edit: the only thing I can think of that might have caused this is I had a colonoscopy on July 7th and never really bounced back from it. Really bad bouts of constipation, sweating and occasional nausea. Could Humira really be the culprit for that all along?

107,Humira,Previous doctor lied?,"So backstory- diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in 2019 and started Humira in 2020 after taking steroids for a while. After being on Humira for a while and doing testing- I believe it was late 2021 or early 2022 my doctor told me that I was in remission. It was confusing to me because I still had symptoms, I would go to him with these symptoms and he would say that there is no evidence of active disease and maybe I just have IBS and would leave it at that. 

At the beginning of the year my insurance switched me from Humira to the biosimilar and I had a bad reaction to it. My doctor basically told me there was nothing he could do because I was going to be moving so just wait until I see the new doctor and they can deal with it basically. 

Fast forward several months and I finally see the new GI doctor. He informs me that my disease has never been in remission, that according to results of previous MRIs and colonoscopies with my previous doctor there is still evidence of inflammation and active disease. Hence, he wants to try a completely different medication rather than go back to the Humira. 

I’m still trying to wrap my head around how my previous doctor could INSIST for YEARS that I was fine and dismiss my symptoms as IBS?! Is this a matter of just a different opinion or is this straight up the doctor lying about the results?! 

I realize no one could really answer these questions definitively based on a single reddit post but I want to see what everyone thinks! ",2025-07-27 22:00:09,CrohnsDisease,3,1mayv2p,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mayv2p/previous_doctor_lied/,2025-07-27
108,Humira,Biologics and travel,"TLDR: I am already immune compromised and don't want to take biologics. Do I have a safer alternative?

Recently diagnosed (29M) but pretty sure I've had this my whole life and previous GI docs told me I was too young for a colonoscopy and was probably just allergic to certain foods. I pushed for a colonoscopy after sharp pain in my lower left abdomen that was not going away and black stool for months. Scope found dysplasia in the sigmoid colon and ulcers in the ileocecal valve. The doctor described my case as mild Crohn's. I also have hydroginitis supportiva so my GI and dermatologist want to put me on Humira since it's the only drug that treats both. My problem is that I have BRCA-1 so I am genetically pre-disposed to cancers, and on top of that cancer runs rampant in my family. My mom died at 50 of ovarian cancer, her mom has chronic leukemia, my paternal grandpa died at 58 from kidney cancer, my dad has been on close watch for pre cancerous conditions in his blood, skin and prostate, and his first cousin died of melanoma at 32. I get upper respiratory infections and sinus infections 4-6 times a year and about once a year I'll get tonsillitis so bad that I can't eat or drink anything and my tonsils bleed. I am also traveling the world for the next 3 years starting in October. I'm terrified of biologics and the increased risk for cancer and other illnesses. Seems wreckless to hinder my immune system when I am exposing myself to tons of viruses and bacteria I have no immunity to by traveling abroad. Also, traveling is not really conducive to biologics since there are no pill forms. 

What else can I take that might be effective for mild Crohn's in the sigmoid colon and ileocecal valve? Should I just risk it and take the biologics? ",2025-07-22 02:41:17,CrohnsDisease,0,1m62m9o,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m62m9o/biologics_and_travel/,2025-07-22

Biopsies weren’t definitive for Chrons but based on my symptoms and what she saw personally during the colonoscopy my doctor believed that I clearly had an IBD that exhibited Chrons like symptoms.  Now this doctor has taken maternity leave and the sub doctor recently saw me and said that based on my biopsy findings he doesn’t believe I have Chrons and took me off all my medication. I was previously on Humira and my symtpoms started clearing, however my body started producing enough antibodies against to start making it ineffective and switched me over to Stelara which hasn’t done much. Meds like Bentyl don’t help either. I’m having a second colonoscopy done next week, but I’m not sure it’s going to helpful. Has anyone else struggled with getting a proper diagnosis?

138,Humira,Am I unsupportive?,"My partner and I have been together for nearly 10 years and have weathered significant ups and downs, including his alcohol addiction (he’s currently in recovery - before, however, his drinking would lead him to act emotionally abusive at times), job losses/changes, and other health challenges aside from his Crohn’s, which was diagnosed many years before we got together. For several months he has been having a flare. His GI is blowing him off and set his next appointment out a couple of months. Right now, he’s unmedicated although in the past he’s been on a a variety of meds including Humira. I don’t know how long this flare will last. 

We talk about his condition, I’ve accompanied him to some medical visits, and I think I’ve been understanding about his limitations. I check in with him during the workday on how he’s feeling and don’t get frustrated when he’s fatigued, goes to bed in the middle of the day, or can’t go out and about.

I try to support him in other ways as well. I do the cooking and basically all of the cleaning. We live in house I’ve lived in since before we got together, and I cover rent and all of the utilities although we share grocery costs. His income has been negatively impacted by his addiction and Crohn’s, and I don’t mind paying more.

That being said, it has been several months since we have been intimate. I don’t get upset but have started to feel insecure about his interest in me, even though I know the last thing he wants to do during his flare is have sex. He sleeps on the couch every night, saying he doesn’t want to disturb my sleep when he gets up to go to the bathroom, even though I’ve told him I don’t mind and that I miss sleeping in the same bed. I feel like we’re drifting apart and losing connection, and that we’re becoming roommates. Our communication has reduced and become more shallow. It’s become awkward to spend time together. With the way our relationship has been going the last several months, I’m starting to feel like he might be using me for housing, etc. I worry that once we lose our connection we won’t be able to rebuild it. 

I’ve told him I’m concerned about this feeling that we’re starting to just be roommates. Initially he wouldn’t even address the subject. Now, he’s told me he feels like I’m being unsupportive and that he doesn’t want to feel guilty for being sick. I don’t know how to get through to him that I love him and care about our relationship, and that is why I’m concerned and want to talk about things before they get worse. I don’t want to make him feel bad or guilty. I want to support him, but I don’t want to lose our connection.

Am I being a jerk? What does an unsupportive partner look like? Sometimes I feel like a monster for being sad and doubting him. I am at a loss and don’t know what to do. ",2025-06-26 07:10:38,CrohnsDisease,7,1lktnix,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lktnix/am_i_unsupportive/,2025-06-26

I deal with chronic pain and loose stool as well as intestinal blockages that come and go. Had a REALLY bad one in 2020, hospitalized for a week and they were prepping for surgery but didn’t sue to Covid. I’ve been back to see the surgeon multiple times and the mentality seems to be that I have not been in the ER so I must be OK.

I’ve been 100% off of all medications for about 3 years. No change in symptoms. Previously I’ve been on Remmicade, Humira, Stelara with zero improvement in tangible symptoms even though they tell me I’m in remission. Because of which every time they have cranked the dose through the roof and I have had mental side effects that they try to counteract with antidepressants. Also, even with great health insurance the cost is still through the roof on medication.

Started to get random bright red blood from the back end and today had a possible fistula at my ostomy scar. 

Kind of at a loss of what to do and need advice. Probably should go to the ER but I already know how that will play out: 

Run some tests
Discharged
Go see your primary
Thanks for coming but go see your GI doc
We can’t see you for another 4+ months
Thanks for coming in. Have you been back to the ER? No, then you’re fine. See you in 9 months.

April 21st 2025 I went to the hospital because my normal right sided pain dude to ""my period"" had aggravated my appendix and I was admitted and started on IV steroids. Pain was like a 8/10 

Had another colonoscopy may 5 2025 and low and behold the inflammation was back. Mild inflammation of terminal ilieum. 

Do any of yall not have reactions to food? I can honestly eat anything as long as it's not super processed or straight milk and cheese dude to constipation. (I may add since the steroids I def can use the bathroom a lot more though!!) so obviously there was swelling. No stricturing or etc.

162,Humira,losing hope,"18f here! i’m about to vent a bit im sorry. i just need somewhere to talk about this :( i was diagnosed with crohn’s disease 10 years ago, and for the majority of those ten years i was in remission. around the beginning of 2024, actually a little earlier, i started feeling worse. stomach was upset, which for some reason caused me to feel feverish. i had good days and bad days, switched meds from humira to skyrizi, then from skyrizi to entyvio. (before humira i was on remicade, but developed antibodies. i was on humira for 4 years, and around the same for remicade) although entyvio brought my inflammatory markers down, i started developing this excruciating stomach pain towards december. this pain was causing severe heart palps, which stressed me out which then started a chain of my symptoms becoming even worse. i went to urgent care for heart stuff, and then a cardiologist, all as this pain kept brewing and becoming worse and worse when i would feel it. once heart problems were ruled out, i became less stressed but the pain just kept on going. it felt like i was trying to squeeze a rock through a tube that was WAY too small for it to fit through. so, i tried prednisone, tapered off nothing changed. eventually, i went to the ER. they put me on fluids and hardcore steroids again, until eventually my symptoms got better EXCEPT the pain. every time i ate. so, surgery was the option! i was really okay with this, but scared of course. i was just tired of the pain. so i got surgery, had a really rough recovery and was in the hospital for a week post op, and got sent home. honestly, after the rough post op stuff was over, i felt really happy. really hopeful, and everything felt so much easier. i do have ocd and horrible health anxiety, so i was constantly anxious about infections but that’s all the stress i really felt. i also got started on stelara, one of the only remaining medicines i have left to go, according to my GI doctor. it’s been over a month and a half since my surgery, and nearly 4 weeks of being on stelara. and guess what? i feel terrible. my stomach is upset, im having diarrhea, and im getting the same feverish fatigue and chills i had before. it’s all coming back, minus the excruciating pain. but you know, i got a taste of normalcy! and it’s all being ripped from my hands and i can’t do anything to control it and i feel like im trapped and running out of options. i’m sitting here. i can’t even stress about regular almost-19-year-old things when i can’t even see a happy future for myself living like this :( i just want to be happy, eat good food, go out and do things, real things!! i’m stressed about education, i haven’t even done anything for it because of this stupid disease, and im so lost. i’m so lost and what’s going to happen if this surgery i had ends up being all for nothing? i went through all of that just to get out of remission immediately? i’m scared and so tired",2025-06-02 03:55:31,CrohnsDisease,3,1l18esr,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l18esr/losing_hope/,2025-06-02
165,Humira,Restarting Remicade and Imuran,"About four years ago, my doctor swapped me from Remicade to Humira and kept Imuran due to elevated calprotectin levels that never went down. I had good results about two years ago and the doctor tapered me off of Imuran because of the long term health risks. 

Fast forward to last year, calprotectin levels went up to about 600, so I started a steroid taper, which did nothing. I got a new doctor who was adamant to switch therapies instead of adding Imuran back. I tried Stelara, which did nothing but elevate calprotectin levels to 2800, so he swapped me to Rinvoq, which seemed to help but only dropped my calprotectin levels to 1000. I also started developing fistulas. As a result, with inflammation on the colonoscopy, he referred me to a Crohn’s specialist. 

This specialist wants to put me on a higher dose of Remicade and Imuran. Blood results show no antibodies, so I should be safe to start it again. Has anyone experienced good results in restarting it? The GI doctor and surgeon want to see if the Remicade will close the fistulas like they did before and bring the inflammation levels back down. I’ve just seen stories about people trying to restart it, but not many success stories.

169,Humira,Name some supplements or vitamins to combat fatigue and  malnourishment,"I am 27 female and I have had crohns for 15 years. I have had one resection and I now have bile malabsorption. 

I am on stelara and have been for about 1 year. I get injections every 8 weeks. It has helped but it is not as good as my azothiorpine which kept me well for 10 years post surgery. I had came out of remission and the Azathioprine damaged my liver. I also failed humira by developing antibodies before starting stelara. I was at points pred steroid dependant. I have had a rough 2 years! It has been hard to regain any semblance of normal health despite now appearing clinical remission (80%). The joint pain and low energy is the worst symptom. I don’t have any rheumatology conditions I sleep about 7 hours a night and never feel rested (even tried melatonin 3mg). Also, I have headaches. I am not sure I am getting enough water or protein/carbs. .

I have been previously deficient in b12, iron, vitamin D and foliate. My levels are now fine apparently (bare minimum of the normal
Baseline so no therapies have been offered). I still feel awful - I have joint pain, stiffness, brain fog, brittle nails/hair, very pale, low energy. I have numbness in my fingers which suggests b12 and anemia issues. I have been looking to improve my health by supplementing since my body fails to absorb everything I need to function.

I am taking: 
Biotin 
Vitamin d 
Folic acid
B12
Omega 3

Is there anything else I should be adding? I sometimes use iron water but not consistently. I was thinking of adding a probiotic or getting b12 injections.

Should I be using electrolytes, creating, protein mixes or magnesium’s. 

I know it would be worthwhile consulting with nutrition or dieticians but the healthcare here isn’t great and has long wait lists. 

If anyone has found any supplements or combos helpful I would be interested in trying them out

I know some probiotics can do more harm than good etc, I'm not looking for a miracle cure. I'm on humira fortnightly injections and my inflammation has been well under control for years. I've also had resection surgery as well as scar removal surgery which have both greatly improved my lifestyle. It's just that I do get a flare up every now and then from certain foods and as careful as I am with what I eat,  I  thought I'd try this to see if it'll help strengthen my gut. Thanks in advance (and yes I'm speaking to my GI about it).

193,Humira,Humira,"Originally diagnosed with UC, but about 4-5 years ago a new GI diagnosed Crohn's.  Not long after I began Entyvio infusions.  After a while, I was having joint aches I originally attributed to aging.  However, the aches (especially ankles) increased in intensity. It hurt to just walk down stairs.  Eventually I self-diagnosed it was the Entyvio (I intentionally missed a monthly infusion and aches began to get better). That kind of joint pain seemed to be rare in my reading on Entyvio. Conferring with GI, he agreed and we switched to Humira about 7-8 months ago. After several months of feeling much better, I am starting to get some joint aches again- though the joint aches are not as bad (yet?) but the larger issue for now seems to be overall muscle aches.  If I get a nice long nights sleep- I feel good in the morning, but by the end of the day, I ache like I did after a long day of doing construction in my younger years but am nowhere near that amount of activity level.  Am 60, but feel like 90 at the end of the day.

So I guess my question is, has anyone else experienced similar muscle/joint aches with Humira? I don't want to jump the gun with blaming Humira. I hate to think about changing biologics yet again- I've got a weird body chemistry as it is- and have struggled with side effects with multiple other meds over the years (not to sound like a hypochondriac, which I am not).

219,Stelara,Increased libido due to improved health?,"Hi

So, this is the weirdest thing I’ve ever asked on Reddit.

I have had Crohns for 35 years, since I was 20. For the last 15 years I’ve had a fistula, which is now basically healed due to a combination of surgery, Stelara, and antibiotics. But there is still a lot of pain, and I take tramacet every day. I’m not in the US, and our medical systems and approved medicines are probably different.

I’ve recently started exercising a lot to try and improve my health, particularly the circulation in my lower body. And it’s been difficult but effective. I’m not a changed person, I’m still old and fat, but I am a much much healthier old fairly fat man, with massively improved circulation in my pelvis and legs.

So that’s all very medical, but what has shocked me is a libido I haven’t had in decades. I feel like a teenager.

Before I talk with my wife (of 25 years) about this huge change and she goes ‘but I don’t wanna’, I wanted to ask if anyone has heard of similar things, if I’m right that the reason is all this exercise, or something actually bad. I haven’t changed medicines at all for quite some time, the only difference is cycling for an hour every day or two for six months, when my baseline was ‘sometimes I walk to the fridge’.

God, this is a weird thing to ask about.",2025-11-04 05:49:46,CrohnsDisease,13,1onzmu4,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1onzmu4/increased_libido_due_to_improved_health/,2025-11-04

On Thursday I had my appointment in hospital and GI proposed to switch to Rinvoq but I insisted on Stelara because I was really scared of side effects of Rinvoq (especially acne) 

That day pain wasn’t that bad so acne for me was worse than having full flare. He told me he has to order Stelara but Rinvoq he can give me rn and it may reduce my symptoms in one week. I proposed to give me last dose of Remi and I’ll have to wait for Stelara for 1,5 months. I thought I will be good but on Sunday things got worse and I had to go to ER. They told me they can’t give me Rinvoq because I have to wait washout time
On Thursday (before Remi) my CRP was 3,65 but on Sunday it raised to 9

I can’t use steroids because I had terrible psychosis on it, so my GI didn’t even propose me that, that’s why i am always so scared of side effects… just because i can suffer from them later…

240,Stelara,Recommended biologics after 1 year of crohns,"I was diagnosed with Crohn’s late last year (2024) after a private colonoscopy. Because of delays with insurance, I didn’t start treatment privately and ended up transitioning to the NHS — which took most of this year to get properly assessed.

Fast forward to now, the NHS gastro team has recommended Ustekinumab (Stelara) as my first treatment. They originally considered Infliximab but changed course because I’ve had uveitis, some neurological symptoms (like brief arm numbness and eye flickering), and a slightly positive Mantoux TB test.

My main symptoms are:

	•	Abdominal pain
	•	Blood in stool
	•	Fatigue
	•	Small perianal skin tag (no fistulas or abscesses, confirmed by colorectal surgeon)

I’ve never been on steroids, 5-ASAs, or immunomodulators like azathioprine. So I’m confused — is it common to go straight to biologics, especially for a case like this? I feel like I’m skipping steps.

Also wondering:

	•	Based on this, would you say I have mild, moderate, or severe Crohn’s?
	•	Has anyone else started with Ustekinumab? How have you found it?
	•	Should I be concerned about long-term risks like immune suppression or HPV flare-ups?

I just want to make a fully informed decision. Most stories I’ve seen involve people starting biologics after years of symptoms or failed meds — so I wasn’t expecting this to be the first step.

TL;DR:
Diagnosed with Crohn’s late 2024. Blood in stool, stomach pain, fatigue, and perianal skin tag (not a fistula). NHS team wants me to start Ustekinumab as first-line treatment. No prior steroids or immunosuppressants. Is that standard? Would you call this mild/moderate/severe?",2025-09-19 15:06:37,CrohnsDisease,1,1nl6313,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1nl6313/recommended_biologics_after_1_year_of_crohns/,2025-09-19
241,Stelara,Getting weird skin “bumps” on my ankle,"Hello, I am 35M and have been diagnosed with Crohn’s close to 20 years. 5-6 months ago I got my first bump on my ankle like a little pimple that came with the start of a flare up. It took a long time to go away and soon I got another. Now I have three (https://postimg.cc/MXnzdkL2) and I’m not sure what they are.

246,Stelara,What changed?,"I’ve had Crohn’s Disease for 8 years. The first 5, while rough trying to get into remission first starting prednisone, starting Remicade, getting drug induced lupus from the Remicade, then switching to Stelara (which has been much better) I feel like something shifted 2 years ago. Maybe I’m naive to think things would just stay the same? But having an “accident” was never a fear of mine. 2 years ago it’s almost like my stomach sensitivity changed and ever since then everyday is a huge gamble with my stomach will act. It’s given me so much anxiety when this would never even cross my mind. I feel like somehow I got myself to be very regular with my bowel movements and then suddenly out of nowhere I go 2-4 times at least, sometimes more. I’m just so confused what happened. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe it’s just the new phase of this disease I’m in. It just sucks so much. I started anxiety meds to help with the anxiety side of it. I wondered if the anxiety was amplifying the symptoms.

247,Stelara,Feeling pretty hopeless,"This is a bit of a whinge, so please ignore if you don't want to see me feeling quite rubbish. 

I've been in a flare since last September, and it's easily the worst I've had since being diagnosed as a child over 20 years ago. I've been hospitalised twice already at the start of the year, and am absolutely terrified that it's going to happen again so just end up staying quiet until I can't bear the symptoms like pain so severe it feels like I'm on fire. Except, it's not even my bowels that's the focus of this flare, it's my skin. I still gave gut symptoms, like opening my bowels 8 times a day on average, episodes of severe abdominal pain that makes it hard to breathe, and nausea so severe that I can throw up without much warning even on meds. But I have never met or spoken with anyone who knows what it's like to have open sores on your skin that refuse to heal, that bleed and itch and ooze, that makes you feel disgusting and afraid of being vulnerable with others in case they don't understand. I put off getting my smear done for almost a year as I knew that the swelling down there was going to make an already borderline painful process feel like being stabbed. I've not been intimate with anyone in just over a year and mostly just isolate myself at home with my cats as I don’t want to deal with letting people down when I have to leave minutes after arriving as the pain from sitting down or pressure at my tailbone is so intense that even the morphine and tramadol aren't helping. 

I have (finally) seen a dermatologist today and I switched from uste/Stelara to riza/Skirizi back in January whilst admitted as I could barely walk or lie down without crying from the pain. I have another scope (OGD) next Friday to hopefully address the nausea and persistent swallowing difficulties. But it's really the skin issues that are getting me so down as I can't even really find someone who really knows how to tackle the issue. Back in Feb this year, a surgeon decided to schedule me for abscess drainage despite telling me there was nothing to drain multiple times. The procedure left me in more pain, which the surgical team didn't even bother to address, and sent a letter ro my GP claiming I could self-manage the woundsites on my groin. I'm not a small person, or a contortionist, so this was an impossible task, even if the pain didn't make me almost pass out when the ward nurses were changing my dressings. She was so rude and didn't even care that my being on riza could have impacted healing from the (unnecessary) surgery, so I'm so worried about ending up in a similar situation if I get hospitalised again. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for really, as I can accept that its not a common issue. But I just hate how much it's taken from me in the past year alone, and that there's no end in sight. I keep being told it's a complex condition to treat, and that im a complex patient, but I'd really like to feel less like I'm just incredibly alone and unlucky in health. I'm even looking into potentially contacting a hospital up in Newcastle (I'm in London) as I'm feeling incredibly frustrated at the lack of progress despite about 10 visits to the A&amp;E of a Trust with the largest dermatology department in the UK, and also one of the world's leading centres for skin disease.

Question/Advice needed from this wonderful community....

  
I Started Stelara (Ustekinumab) in March 2025, I had immediate improvement from my infusion, since then every 8 weeks i do a self injection at home, I've just done my 3rd home injection Tuesday (2 days ago)

  
**I've been fantastic ever since**... until Around 2 weeks or so ago, 

I randomly had diarrhoea after eating a take-out &amp; a cough/blocked nose etc (a few people are saying a small bug might be circulating)

...Since then, I've not really had a solid BM, Urgency has Massively come back &amp; Watery/Mucusy stools too.

I'm now panicking thinking, **what if** the Meds are failing... 

I'm still fairly new to this game, having only been diagnosed around 20 months ago... Or am i just going through a small flare? Potentially fighitng off a bit of a bug my self?

     I started stelara from February to June and failed it so I began Skyrizi in July. I drank for the first time since starting biologics this week and I had a few drinks which any other time would have gotten me drunk.

275,Stelara,Any advice for Remicade reaction?,"Hello all. I’m currently suffering through having a reaction to trying remicade and would appreciate any advice or just commiseration if you’ve experienced. 

I had Remicade once about 20 years ago (originally diagnosed with UC) - it shot me right into remission but never took it again. 

Flash forward today, I have no colon but have upgraded to Crohns as I have small bowel inflammation. My GI wanted to start me back on Remicade as I failed Stelara. 

I had no reaction to the first infusion and felt amazing for the first time in years. But a week later the itching started - hives and rash. I went to urgent care and was prescribed a 6 day course of pred 50. My GI was pissed as she had asked me to be premeditated for the infusion but I wasn’t. She still wanted me to go and attempt infusions #2 however. 

So 2 days ago, 10 minutes into infusion #2 I have a major reaction, heart pounding, turned beet red, threw up. They pumped me full of Benadryl and iv steroids and felt better.  My dr. wanted me to attempt to finish the infusion but I refused. 

Last night I woke up with 60% of my body in rash and hives. Took my final pred 50 this morning to no effect. If anything I’m noticing my mouth and tongue are getting swollen and feeling a disturbing chest tightness. 

So I went to the ER. Administered an EPI, more iv steroids and Benadryl and now Pepcid. They watched me for 4 hours and by the end the hives were already coming back. They offered to discharge or stay in observation but as I’m an American I went home. Have a pred scrip to taper down from 50 over 2 weeks. 

I am supposed to be out of town next weekend but don’t know about that now. The ER dr. estimated I might be reacting for a few weeks to this. If anyone has been through and let me know how long it lasted, if it slowly got better or would wax and wane, what besides steroids you used for relief, I’d really appreciate it. I’d rather have my Crohns pain than this. :(

Onto Slyrizi now, if insurance agrees. ",2025-07-18 20:55:36,CrohnsDisease,1,1m3dqkd,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1m3dqkd/any_advice_for_remicade_reaction/,2025-07-18

279,Stelara,Diverticulitis or Crohns'? Choose Your Own Adventure!,"A bit of a rant here, so take that into account.  For the past three weeks, I've been having a flare, but a weird one: constipation one day, diarrhea the next, and then everything's fine--and then the cycle starts over again.  I've also had bad bloating for a day or two, and anal fissures (which are healing, at least).  I had a full blood workup for my Stelara and it showed my inflammatory markers as very high, so I figured that was probably the reason, and the Stelara infusion I have scheduled this Thursday--which I won't chicken out on this time--should get the process going.  

But last night, I started getting nausea, and I wasn't doing much more than deer poop, so I decided it was ER time.  Doctor Hollywood on duty says ""We need to do a CT scan because you have Crohn's.""  No problem, but I'm allergic to the contrast.  He takes this as a personal insult and finally says ""Fine!"" after the CT tech flat refuses to give me contrast; we go in raw.  The CT scan comes back and it's diverticulitis.

That leads me to ask some questions.  Isn't diverticulitis extremely painful? Yes, but I haven't had any but very off and on light pain.  Shouldn't my white blood count be elevated? Yes, but it isn't.  Shouldn't I be running a fever? Possibly, but no fever.  ""Don't care,"" says the doc, ""the CT shows diverticulitis, and we're putting you on antibiotics.""  Er, okay, but doesn't the AMA's current guidelines show that you *don't* give antibiotics for diverticulitis when it's uncomplicated? ""Those change all the time.  You're getting antibiotics.""

Okay, I'll do it, because I don't want to get an abscess.  What kind of antibiotics? ""Augmentin.""  Whoa, Dr. Venkman, augmentin is *bad* for people with Crohn's.  Like *I will get c diff* bad.  Got anything else? ""Cipro.  Cipro or Augmentin.  Those are your choices.""  How about Bactrim or Doxy?  ""No! Cipro or Augmentin.""  Funny that both Bactrim and Doxy are apparently recommended for people who can't tolerate stronger antibiotics, but Doc Brown has a playbook and he's going to follow it.  

I went and got a second opinion from a PA that was terrified to go against the doctor, but did at least send a referral to my GI PA and my primary.  

I'm open to the possibility that this is indeed diverticulitis and yes, I need antibiotics.  But gad, I am tired of these doctors whose first, last, and only option is to throw antibiotics at something until the patient goes away or dies.  I just have this feeling that tomorrow either my GI PA or my primary says ""It's not diverticulitis, it's Crohn's.  Ride it out.""  

Rant over, though I could use some advice if anyone else has gone through this.

(Both resulted from sitting in a car traveling over 4000 miles in the space of six days.)  The fissures have pretty much healed up, but for the past 48 hours, I haven't been going much--or rather, I've been going 3-4 times a day, but not much has been coming out.  What comes out looks normal, no blood or anything, but...just not much there.  It also took longer than usual for things to get moving, and it feels like things are hanging up right at the end...if you know what I mean, and you probably do.

This morning, I had a fairly normal BM and just now some diarrhea.  Otherwise I feel fine, other than a bit of pain on the lower left side over my hip, which has been coming and going for the last month.

Since I've been traveling, I haven't been eating remotely right, with fast food for dinner and road snacks otherwise, and yesterday we were so tired and got home so late I went right to bed without eating anything substantial.  Normally, I wouldn't worry too much, but 1) I've got Crohn's and 2) I'm a hypochondriac, so I'm wondering if this is a stricture, constipation, stress from a long vacation, or even stenosis from healing fissures.

My 14-year-old niece was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease when she was 12, and it’s been a long, emotional journey with many ups and downs. Early on, when we were taking her to different ERs, trying to figure out what was wrong, her appendix was removed. She’s since been on two or three different medications and is currently on Stelara.

Right now, she’s struggling with very low hemoglobin and vitamin D levels. One of our biggest challenges is that she dislikes taking her prescribed iron and vitamin D supplements, which makes managing her condition even harder. She also needs frequent blood tests, but her veins have become small, or in my opinion, just tired, from being poked so many times.

Lately, she’s been having terrible headaches, a toothache, and has started throwing up at school from time to time—like just yesterday. Because of the pain, she recently overdosed on acetaminophen.

Before I had experienced severe joint pain when I was flaring bad back in June of last year (I hadn't started Skyrizzi yet, was on prednisone at the time and stelara).

326,Stelara,Advice regarding flare up?,"Recently I started having sudden pain and diarrhea after not having it outside of occasionally for a while. I don’t know if I’d say I’m ever fully in total remission bc I have hard days even while still having formed stool but this sucks. 

A few days ago I started having very very sharp pain that came in waves and reminded me of the pain I had when I needed to have a bowel resection due to a narrowing. After speaking with my GI he suggested I get a CT done and I could wait to schedule with him or go to the ER if it got bad enough. The CT isn’t till next week so I ended up going to the ER last night for the pain, mostly worried I’d need surgery and in that case that pain doesn’t let up till you’re surgically fixed. 

The ER did a ct with contrast and said I difnt have any obstruction or stenosis that would lead the one and sent me home. The pain and nausea meds they gave me helped, but I wasn’t worried about pain maintenance so much bc I have pain meds on standby for this. It actually kinda pissed me off bc I walked in telling them I’m good on that front, I have used my own pain medication today, I rly don’t need anything narcotic wise but if I asked if they could give me like bentyl for the cramping bc it might help more. And five mins later they were giving me IV hydromorphone aka dilaudid and I was thinking “I kind of refuse it and I’m given it without asking anyway but the times I’ve mentioned how bad my pain was they acted weird about it.” I found that part weird. 

Anyway, I think I have to just be flaring which is kind of an issue bc I just did my stelara dose like 4 days ago and so far it’s helped me a lot. I have a colonoscopy scheduled for 2 weeks from now but I don’t feel like I can wait until then for my GI to prescribe something else. I’m not supposed to take steroids bc of another condition I have that gets worse with steroids. So I’m not sure what options I have now bc that was usually something offered to me short term to cut a flare. 

I don’t know if my GI will switch my biologic before the colonoscopy so I wanted to ask here if you guys have any advice? Going back years ago I did try antibiotics short term but those never rly seemed to help. It’s always been either prednisone or a biologic for me.

UPDATE:  I reviewed all your information and spoke with my doctor. I said the targeted meds such as Skyrizi and Stelara are appealing. I said that I have some interest in Remicade as well, but I’m concerned with the side effects and I might want to save that one for later in case I end up with another autoimmune disease as well such as RA.

I was diagnosed with Chrons in June 2025, the budesonide didn't clear up the inflammation, so I was asked basically to choose between Skyrizi and Entyvio as biologic starter options. I had no real way to differentiate between them aside from Google, so I asked the advice of the person in the chair,  and she felt Skyrizi on body injections might be easier to manage. Honestly, I still don't really ""want to manage"" any of this. But I understand that if I don't at least try the biologics it will be worse for me in the long run...

I'm scared. Probably like many of you are or were. My body doesn't tolerate most antibiotics well (horrible symptoms or allergies) so opening myself up to the chance of more infections seems like a really bad combination. 

I don't know if anyone has any advice in combating the anxiety around biologics causing allergic reactions or new unpleasant symptoms, but I'd love to hear it if you do.

343,Skyrizi,"Joint pain, ?flare, Skyrizi","My Crohn’s history: started having GI symptoms in 2021, diagnosed with Crohn’s in August 2024 (on my birthday 🙂) and started Skyrizi in October 2024. I was doing every 8 weeks until my last dose which was after just 6 weeks and I am to continue with 6 week intervals from here on. My doctor also recommended I try CurQD in addition to the Skyrizi, so I have done that for the past month.

I thought I was starting to do a bit better with my GI symptoms about a month ago, but have had a lot of days lately in which I am struggling with nausea, lack of appetite, weight loss, and joint pain. My labs in September were all normal. 

The joint pain was present before I started Skyrizi, but not like it is now. I wake up with achy hips and knees, just sitting on the couch I feel my knees throbbing right now. I am active - been a powerlifter for 10 years and never had issues like this. I eat as solid a diet as I am able based on my current symptoms (I am a dietitian). The joint pain is getting to me. I am only 29, but maybe this is just getting older with this disease?

I went on a trip to Nashville for a hockey game and since I hadn’t had an accident in awhile I decided to try to wean myself off depends and wear pads. I wanted to wear my favorite leggings with my jersey for the game. I did really well for the game. However, I forgot to change into a depends before bed… I was staying at a camp site and the bathroom was very close. I woke up having to run to the bathroom and of course I didn’t make it. I had to have my friend bring me a depends, wipes, and new pants. But what sucked even more is I had to wait until all the women left the bathroom for him to hurry in and slide the stuff under the stall door. I’m just sick of how unpredictable this is. I made sure to eat light, I haven’t drank in years, stay hydrated, etc. but yet it still happened. Also, having to explain to pretty much everyone I meet I have crohns destroys me on its own. It’s just so embarrassing. I was doing well with explanations but now after the accident during the trip and having to go back to wearing joggers 24/7.. it’s just hurting my soul. 😔 I miss wearing underwear and actual pants/leggings. I’m starting my first skyrizi at home injection tomorrow. I’m hoping this does the trick because it’s been +10 years since I was diagnosed and I’ve yet to be in remission.

did my follow up endoscopy/colonoscopy after a year on Skyrizi today &amp; was curious to hear some questions I could ask my GI on next steps. 

My results were .5-2cm ulceration in terminal ileum last year &amp; a narrowing of the IC valve.  This years colonoscopy showed .5/2cm ulceration &amp; the narrowing is gone, so I guess that’s a slight win. My endoscopy results showed everything was normal &amp; colon was normal also.  

My doc who did the surgery recommended it’d be best I consider switching off skyrizi, however I’ve felt like there were times I’ve been good on it &amp; have had some super healthy looking stools.  He also said it appeared my crohns was specific to my ileum.

I’m super scared to switch &amp; don’t know what the process of starting something else will be.  I don’t want to restart &amp; feel how I felt before I was on a biologic, &amp; I really enjoyed how easy it was to be on the skyrizi (1 shot every 2 months &amp; it’s at home).

395,Skyrizi,Is my doctor trying to take advantage of me? Just diagnosed starting meds soon,"I just finally got diagnosed this week with Crohns after years of vague diagnosis and medical exams. The doctor didn’t tell me before the appointment that the last results finally gave him what he needs to definitively needed to diagnose me - even though I suggested since day one that it was crohns due to multiple of my family members having it, and my symptoms being the same. 

Anyways, I came prepared for the appointment with a bunch of questions unrelated to crohns (because I thought it was going to be another failed appointment). 

My doctor went over the different medications with me, but never mentioned the hugely variable prices that medications can cost. He pushed me towards a certain medication citing the safety of it and ease of use long term, but he never wrote it down on my portal or after office visit form. I had to ask them in the portal which one they suggested and had sent to my insurance company so that I could start researching it and other medications properly. 

I just got a response, and it turns out that it is Skyrizi - possibly the most expensive medication coming out to around $100k/year before insurance. I’ve seen other people on here saying that they take medications which cost them between $5-100 per unit after insurance. I can guarantee my insurance won’t ask me to pay that little. 

The kicker is that he said my crohns is still considered mild to moderate. So why would I need the most expensive one - besides the fact that he cited this medication as the safest and not having long term cancer risks or other things of that sort.

402,Skyrizi,Convinience Skyrizi vs Entyvio,"Hey folks ,

It’s my first time starting medication, and I’ve been offered two options: **Skyrizi** and **Entyvio**.  
I did some research, and both seem like very good drugs.

Personally, I prefer **Entyvio** because it’s a **gut-focused drug** with one of the safest profiles.  
At the same time, I also like **Skyrizi** for its **convenience** — self-injections every 8 weeks compared to every 2 weeks with Entyvio.  
On the plus side, Entyvio pens can be stored at **room temperature for up to 7 days**, which helps with flexibility.

How does this affect your daily life when it comes to **vacations, travel, or planning activities** — especially with the 2-week dosing schedule?

The minor side effects of acne and weight gain are already enough to put me off - but increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cancer while I’m at this age and a breast cancer survivor definitely has me wary and anxious.

* A 6mm tubular adenoma (transverse colon) that was removed

My calprotectin a couple months earlier was 165 µg/g. The gastroenterologist said this could represent mild/early Crohn’s, giving estimates between 50–90%. He plans to start me on Entocort, and if symptoms return, move to Skyrizi.

My internal medicine specialist, however, doubts Crohn’s and thinks it could be something else/nonspecific. That’s been confusing, since I’m hearing mixed opinions and reading conflicting stories.

Currently, my bowel habits fluctuate between constipation, diarrhea, and normal stools. Part of me wonders if this could be from the 10–15 pills I was taking daily for about 1.5 years (mostly supplements, but also doxycycline 100 mg 2x/day and fluconazole 100 mg 2x/week—no NSAIDs). Honestly, it felt like the pills triggered it.

I’m just looking for input—has anyone else had similar findings that turned into Crohn’s, or did it resolve as something other than IBD??

431,Skyrizi,Does Tylenol ever help when you don’t have your medicine?,"Hey folks, found this sub quite literally on accident a few weeks back and I’ve been lurking ever since because of how informative and safe it feels as a community! My story is back in December out of nowhere I started getting this pain once or twice a day after eating, eventually made the connection in my head and it really killed my appetite - to the point I lost somewhere between fifty and sixty pounds before I finally found a G.I. doc in February. After a colonoscopy/endoscopy in March due to my late father’s colon cancer history, Crohn’s was the diagnosis (and a CT scan and an X-ray seems to have confirmed it).

Unfortunately haven’t had the time to get set up on Skyrizi yet, lots of other shit was going on this year that keep throwing me off track unfortunately, but my first appointment for that is tentatively set for the 16th!! Problem is I’ve been prescribed nothing in the meantime, so I’m still dealing with some random gurgling in my stomach/intestines that’s really just a bit of pain with nowhere to go for a few seconds. Is Tylenol something that’s successful for you when you don’t have any sort of prescribed by a doctor medicine, or should I be putting a call into my doc’s office to hopefully get something in the meantime? Or at this point should I just try to ride it out since that first Skyrizi appointment is so close?",2025-09-02 02:27:04,CrohnsDisease,0,1n67tu7,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1n67tu7/does_tylenol_ever_help_when_you_dont_have_your/,2025-09-02

437,Skyrizi,Stolen moments,"This is more of a rant/super pity party 🥳and I'm inviting all of my Chronies.

I (47F) have had my diagnosis since I was 22/23.  I was in remission for over 20 glorious yeas.  However, the past 2 years drug after drug has been failing.  I truly think there's a correlation between perimenopause and the stress of this evil administration, but I digress. 
This past winter, I tanked.  I was barely able to hobble through the holidays.  Only with the amazing support of my immediate family and parents/in-laws was I able to do the bare minimum.  But I missed out on so many things that I usually would have been able to do.  
I had 4 good months on Entyvio.  That has now -also- failed me.  My entire summer was lost to the toilet, pain, fatigue, weight loss, and bed.  I started Skyrizi, but I'm still on the struggle bus.  
Fast forward to this morning; the first day of school.  Every year, I take pictures of my children and put them on the bus.  It's a small thing, but it makes my mama-heart happy.  Today was the first day of my oldest senior year and I wasn't able to do this small thing because I had to run to the bathroom.  I'll never get that moment back.  This BASTARD of a disease takes and takes and takes.  I know that this will (hopefully, by the grace of the goddess, ancestors, and good juju) be temporary.  But, UGH!!!
Anyway, sending light and happy immune systems to my people.  Protein shakes will be served on the veranda.

 I was just diagnosed with Crohn’s. I’ve honestly never had stomach issues until recently, after starting a biologic for psoriasis that ended up causing IBD. Since then it’s been nonstop, and today I finally got my diagnosis.

I’m really scared and don’t even know where to start. How much does this affect your life long-term? Is life basically over now? Will I ever be able to eat my favorite foods again or eat normally without worrying? This is last on my list right now, but what about drinking? I am also scared and I know it's rare and varies, but surgery?? 

I also feel really nervous about medications. I don’t want to be sick, but I’m also scared of side effects since that’s what got me into this mess in the first place. My doctor is hoping my insurance approves Skyrizi, but for now I’m starting a prednisone taper tomorrow (about a month). How has prednisone been for you?

Then super hot weather started in July (I live in FL) and my symptoms started getting worse especially two weeks before my scheduled dose and a week after my dose. I called my doctor and she insisted I was probably just constipated and I needed to take miralax, well I did and it didn't help. So I called again and got an MRI scheduled. The MRI showed mild inflammation/subtle narrowing and some moderate constipation. My doctor's office called and said she wants me to start taking laxatives daily. I don't understand why my doctor is so obsessed with treating just my constipation and not the actual inflammation that is causing the constipation. Even my calprotectin comes back moderately high (200-450 range) and the office just tells me she's not concerned bc my ""scopes looked good"".

Basically for about 6 weeks after my doses I have almost no stomach issues, I have a boost in confidence, and a reduction of overall anxiety and overthinking.  I am not just talking about anxiety revolving the disease itself either.  But right around week 7 right before I take my next dose, I notice stomach starts to get burny again, with the feelings of incomplete evacuation as well more diarrhea like symptoms.  Along with this I notice an overall increase in anxiety and the inability to brush things aside or get over issues as easily not even related to the disease.  This seems to go away again the next few days after the following dose.

I really wonder if something is actually happening or if skyrizi could even do this and I have created a placebo effect of some kind.",2025-08-09 18:43:43,CrohnsDisease,2,1mlwwqc,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1mlwwqc/anxiety_reduction_with_skyrizi/,2025-08-09

Started Infliximab Oct 2023 - improved for about 4 months then began to decline again. Took til end Dec 2024 before they checked trough levels, which came back low and no antibodies, but my GI switched me to Skyrizi instead of increasing the dose (which I regret).

Started Skyrizi Feb 2025, consultant wanted to give it til my 5th dose in July to kick in before considering surgery as next step.

Sadly there’s been no improvement with Skyrizi but I’m not convinced surgery is the right move just yet? So I want to be fully informed and ready to discuss other med options at my next appointment in Sept.

(Also planning to ask for a different consultant moving forward as the current one hasn’t been great for a number of reasons.)

I was on oral pred from Oct 2024 to May 2025, with two hospital admissions for bonus IV steroids. Off steroids for 2 months now but am declining again, and suspect I’ll need hospital before the end of August.



So… if Infliximab and Skyrizi failed you, what med would you choose next?

463,Skyrizi,"Considering Antidepressants, Need Advice","Hi Crohnies,

**About me:** 31M, USA, diagnosed with moderate crohns ~2 years ago after lifelong issues, 1.5 years on Skyrizi, in clinical remission per last colonoscopy ~8 months ago. 

I have dealt with anxiety and depression since my late teens. Other than as-needed klonopin for panic attacks, I have always managed to use lifestyle changes to get by without going on antidepressants. I was afraid of side effects, particularly GI side effects. 

Lately though, depression has come back hard. Low moods are lasting longer and getting harder to shake. 

This is partially due to my Crohn's. The tests say I am in remission since being on Skyrizi, but there is an 8 week dosing schedule and I only feel good gut-wise for about 3-4 weeks in the middle. Other times I have disruptive IBS-D symptoms, and have restricted my diet. 

I have appointments with my PCP and GI docs this month and plan to ask about going on antidepressants. My questions:

1. Which antidepressant medications do you take? Do you find they make your GI symptoms better or worse? 
2. Am I foolish to believe that taking an antidepressant might ease my IBS-D symptoms?
1. Did anyone here start antidepressants after starting a biologic? Were there any impacts on your crohn's treatment?

Thanks for your advice.

I was diagnosed with Crohn's earlier this year, but I have had some other inflammation, and I wanted to see if anyone else here has experienced any of this. Back in 2019, I started getting really painful nodules in my lower legs (Erythema nodosum, I'm pretty sure) as well as some eye pain that the ophthalmologist told me was swelling in my eye. It eventually went away after about six weeks. 

In October 2024, I went to the doctor and got my COVID booster and flu shot, and immediately got sick after and had the strangest cough situation. I guess it triggered an autoimmune reaction. It was basically a dry cough, a tickle in my throat, and I would cough for a few hours, and it would go away. It happened more frequently at first and then slowly decreased over the following months to about 2 hours a week. I would cough and nothing else. I got an X-ray, the CT with contrast, then a PET, and my pulmonologist determined I have nodules and they should biopsy. The biopsy results indicated no infection of any kind, so my thought was, 'Okay, it's sarcoidosis.' I just met with him today, and he still can't definitively say it's sarcoidosis, apparently, and he thinks the inflammation is related to Crohn's.

I’m currently being treated for Crohn’s and recently started Skyrizi. I completed my 3 loading IV infusions (I don’t know the dosage), and then at week 12, I received my first maintenance dose, but they gave me only 180 mg subcutaneously instead of the full 360 mg.

My GI mentioned she wanted to “start me low,” but now I’m concerned that this might not be enough to keep my symptoms under control and might increase my risk of developing antibodies.

Has anyone else had their first maintenance dose underdosed like this?
Did your doctor correct it at the next scheduled 8-week dose?
Did it affect your symptoms or antibody development?

503,Skyrizi,Skyrizi / Complete loading dose reimbursement inquiry,"Hello all,

I've had Crohn's for 25+ years and my latest flare had me on Skyrizi for a couple months before switching to Rinvoq. 

I've been using the Complete App for both medicines and the copay assistance has been a blessing for this gift from hell.

The copay assistance covered the Skyrizi injectables but not the out-patient infusion loading doses.  I started looking into the possibility of that and got mixed messages with one person saying that is not normally covered with the copay assistance and someone else saying there are some documents that would need obtained from insurance and then it would be looked into with no assurance that it could cover.  

So this post is to see if anyone has been through this scenario and successfully had the loading doses reimbursed through Complete, before I dig in my heels and begin another insurance battle. Luckily I hit my out of pocket max by late summer this year, but I still am on the hook for $3,000 (with insurance) for one loading infusion from this year.

  
Thank you in advance for any info and help. I hope you all have scattered joys in your days.",2025-06-26 22:16:06,CrohnsDisease,1,1lldcna,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lldcna/skyrizi_complete_loading_dose_reimbursement/,2025-06-26
504,Skyrizi,Does anyone else struggle during hot weather?,"45f, diagnosed September 2024. Had surgery for a stricture in December and started Skyrizi in January. Where I live we are dealing with a heat wave right now, my workplace doesn’t have air conditioning. It is currently 93 degrees in my building and still have half a day left. 

I feel extremely hot, however I am not sweating. Is that normal for Crohn’s disease or the Skyrizi? I told my boss I may need to leave early because of the heat and all that got me was some rude name calling for complaining about the heat. 

I am drinking a good bit of water, just not sure if the no sweating thing is common or not.

I 27F have used Skyrizi for a little over a year.
And sinds then i have gotten eczema (dishydrotic) on my hands and feet.

I never thought that the skyrizi would have caused it but i got the eczema 1month after starting Skyrizi.

Also the eczema gets worse and better regardless of the creme i use. So i am guessing it has to do with the injections.
Right now it is really really calm, but i have my next injection next week so i guess i will find out if it gets worse again...yay me 😭.

Does anyone else have this side effect?

Yesterday I started Skyrizi, without talking to my normal GI due to not being able to get an appt, etc. The surgical assistant/surgeon cleared me and both thought I should start right away. Talked to my GI today, who said she would have waited for me to start because I could be in remission from the surgery. Now I am anxious about starting it if I didn't need it. What are your opinions?

My doctor gave me the choice to switch to Rinvoq and having been on Skyrizi for a year, I did since I figured that I’d seen the best possible scenario. After being on Rinvoq for 3 days I feel like my symptoms haven’t improved at all. I know this is a short time frame but I keep seeing comments about how I should notice something by now. 

Now I feel like I should’ve maybe just accepted the Skyrizi. Maybe some of us don’t get the luxury of not bleeding, not having bad calprotectin and iron levels.

In december I was supposed to get one more skyrizi shot, which would hold me over during the disgustingly long processing time rinvoq has. But his office sent both the skyrizi prescription and the rinvoq to a pharmacy I'd never used before, and it was the holidays, so I never got that shot, and I didn't start rinvoq until mid January. Meaning I started it unmedicated for a month and a half. 

Then, rinvoq pills fucking SUCKED. While I was on them, I lost close to 50 lbs, and I'm cold all of the time, and everything hurts, and I'm just exhausted and can't do anything. When I finally got the dr to agree to put me back on skyrizi, it was once again a 2.5 week wait to get everything processed, and I just finally got my first infusion today. 

But I miss being able to do things with my friends and I miss having a clean house and I miss taking my dog on adventures and I miss writing so much because I'm either puking or shitting or sleeping.

A year goes by. that seton fell out. I have so much scar tissue and it’s not healing on its own so I have to go get a new one placed. They make the hole even bigger this time. Seton is placed and yes I am still dealing with shit leaking out of this hole alllll the time. I finally get on rinvoq which helps me a lot but it’s been almost 3 yrs and I’m still not in remission. The seton fell out again and at this point they decide it isn’t doing anything because I have scar tissue now so it’s just permanent hole that shit leaks out of. Sometimes it’s worse than others. This weekend it has been a nightmare. I was at a music festival and the bathrooms were alllll out of toilet paper and I ran out of pads to catch the leaky shit and I was bawling my eyes out from the stress and the grossness of having to deal with this. I am back home and it is continuing to leak. As soon as I take a poop (even if it’s a good one) it will leak pretty much every time I go sit back down. I’m a 28yo girl and I have to decide whether to get back up and change to a new pad every time it happens or to sit in my shit for a while because it’s just going to happen again as soon as I change it. And this is what I’ll deal with for the rest. Of. My. Life. Because there is apparently nothing else they can do. They can’t sew it shut. They can’t plug it. I have so much scar tissue anyways. It’s permanent. I’m so sick of this. End rant. ",2025-10-15 20:23:41,CrohnsDisease,68,1o7m3li,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1o7m3li/vent_fistula/,2025-10-15

My Crohn's is primarily perianal and the itch can be so bad that I wake up during the night... not to mention a minimum of 4 trips to the toilet every morning and then sporadically throughout the day.

I'd love to hear from anyone on Rinvoq about how it's been.  My GI was really positive about it and said that I'm the ideal candidate, especially with recent studies showing it to be the most effective for perianal Crohn's.

643,Rinvoq,Rinvoq Side Effects,"I feel like I’m going crazy and before I get into this rant/side effects I am seeing my DR in October it keeps getting pushed but hopefully it doesn’t anymore and I can switch medicines. 

I have been on Rinvoq since April I started with 45 and was feeling fine maybe a bit drowsy during the day and needing naps nothing too bad. I take it when I wake up.

Then in June I went down to the 30 and ever since then if I fall asleep before being quite literally exhausted I wake up from the most realistic and scary nightmare within 1-2 hours of falling asleep. Even melatonin doesn’t keep me asleep for longer than 3 hours at most and that’s if my body doesn’t just ignore it. Then once I wake up from a nightmare I can’t go back to sleep till i’m exhausted (usually like 6am+) and past out which then I’ll get like 6 hours of restless sleep where i’m twisting and turning and wake up for a couple seconds every hour. 

I can’t get a job if I can’t sleep at night and I can’t get good sleep that actually allows me to be awake the whole day without being drowsy with these nightmares waking me up constantly.

I feel like i’m going crazy because I don’t see anyone else talking about this side effect and I’m afraid my Dr will brush it off since it’s not a common side effect but i’m on no other medicine that would be causing this.

658,Rinvoq,Insurance blows,"I am so sick of my insurance with their stupid pre-authorization bs. 

First, they took an eternity to approve rinvoq. Ok fine it's expensive, you want to see that it's needed. 

Finally got it, and they approved the loading dose but I picked it up on the 28th of January after they approved it on the 20th. But somehow theygave a pre-authorization date of January first so when it came time to pick up my 3rd batch of 28 pills for the loading dose it was no longer pre approved?? It was a total headache to figure out, finally got that straight.

Now it turns out, I have been on it for 6 months so they need to re authorize the prescription. But that requires an office visit and my doctor is booked until December 22nd. I got on her assistant's schedule for August and on the cancellation wait-list but come on. Seriously? If the insurance knew they'd want me to see a doctor again 6 months after starting, why was I not informed until 2 days ago??? The pre-approval expires on the 17th, so here's hoping my labs show whatever they want and they can re authorize the medication before I am actually seen by the prescribing doctor...

661,Rinvoq,Rinvoq for fistulizing Crohn's?,"Hi all,

I've been diagnosed with stricturing and fistulizing Crohn's. I started with infliximab, but after the loading doses, it looked like we would need to up the dosage to see results. However, with a family history of multiple sclerosis, my GI and I decided it was too risky. So, now I'm about to start Rinvoq since it's had some promising results with fistulizing Crohn's in early studies. 

Honestly, I'm in a lot of pain and just feeling a little defeated and scared knowing the gold standard for fistulizing Crohn's treatment is off the table. So, I'm just looking for any personal anecdotes from those of you on Rinvoq. Especially if you, too, are lucky enough to have fistulizing Crohn's. 🥲

662,Rinvoq,AbbVie denied me my Rinvoq this month and for the foreseeable future..,"I had been expecting my shipment to be sent by at least a week ago. When I did not receive it, unfortunately I had to call about what could be going on. No communication beforehand. 

After being on the phone for over an hour I was told they would not send it because an overdue charge of $9,000 from the last 2 months. As insurance apparently only covered about half the cost each time. Again I was not told this before. There’s obviously no way I can pay $9,000 up front, so they offered setting up a payment plan.. of $780 a month for 12 months. Because they only do up to 12 month payment plans. 

How exactly am I gonna pay for that? As someone who is currently unemployed, and has been in the hospital twice in the last 6 weeks (finally reaching my insurance premium). I don’t even know anybody who’s employed and has other expenses who can just drop $780 a month. 
I’m fortunate enough to still be on my parent’s insurance, which helps a lot. However they still aren’t able to pay that amount of money for Rinvoq. It’s just so frustrating. I do not qualify for Rinvoqs financial aid, as I applied before and got denied. 

Anyways I cried on the phone asking if there was any way I could still get my medicine so I don’t flare up again- and they were so heartless in telling me no. 

I don’t know what to do, as I took my last pill yesterday. I’ve already sent a message to my GI and she doesn’t have any openings to see her until end of September. It would also be a new patient appointment- so until then I have no choice but to suffer?? 

Honestly I already have been. These last 2 ER appointments were for severe abdominal and joint pain, and inconclusive on why. No inflammatory markers in bloodwork were abnormal and they refused further screening. “we don’t really know, could be Crohn’s, could be another autoimmune thing. It just doesn’t seem emergent. You can keep taking Tylenol until you’re able to see your GI” 

😐 in September. 

So yeah I guess I’m just feeling really upset, and defeated. I could have honestly already been in a flare the last couple weeks- but now with no access to any biologic I fear it’ll only get worse. It’s scary, and unfortunately nobody will help until my crohns starts to kill me again I guess.

670,Rinvoq,Colectomy with HGD,"Hey guys, I have UC but I really need advice so I was wondering if you guys could help out. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with HGD in march, and I was told I would need a total colectomy, but they will reassess in May. Well may hit and unfortunately I still have some HGD dysplasia. They booked surgery for me for July 7th.

The thing that’s making me reconsider surgery is the fact that I feel so much better ever since starting Rinvoq. For the first time I don’t have pain every single time I pass a stool and I can finally gain weight for once. Also, the most recent colonoscopy shows more LGD than HGD, which is an improvement from the last one. I’m also starting uni in the fall and I’m terrified of having to dorm while having a bag. I do understand that there’s the j pouch but I don’t want to have to go to the bathroom more than 4 times a day like I used to do pre-Rinvoq.

I guess I’m asking you guys if it’s worth to do the surgery knowing that things are getting a little better? I know that I have a huge risk of cancer but I’m really young and I don’t think I could handle the bag or the j pouch. I’m also worried that things could be worse if don’t do the surgery too.

I've been fortunate to feel well for most of the time since, however, I started to get a regular stinging sensation between my butt cheeks about 2 weeks ago. It coincided with my running a 5k race as hard as I could. I now regret this!

On Friday, this took a real turn for the worse. The pain ramped up. There was lots of blood and I can feel a lump beneath my right butt cheek (albeit, no pain in this area). Every time I now do a BM, it feels like I'm pooping glass and the stinging lasts for ages. I use a bidet. I also get this regular urge to clench my anus, but this is really painful.

I don't have any pain elsewhere and very little gas.

I had similar symptoms a couple of years ago. Fistula was confirmed in an MRI scan, but the symptoms subsided soon after.

My questions are:

- Has anyone felt the similar urge to clench? Do you know why this happens?
- Can abscess or fistula in itself cause really loose stools? I've had 4 x (typically) watery BMs since Friday.
- Is there anything I can do to ease the pain, particularly during a BM? It's becoming unbearable. I already use Germoloids cream.",2025-05-14 19:34:34,CrohnsDisease,1,1kmoaac,https://reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kmoaac/perianal_disease/,2025-05-14

697,Rinvoq,Rinvoq Complications.,"I don't even know where to start, to be honest. 
Anemia was the first thing that popped up, along with acne. And for a young woman, that is enough to cause me stress. 
I took multiple IV infusions of iron, and my hemoglobin levels went up maximum 9, but mostly, it's in the 7-8 range. It's madding, really. 
And the acne...is well, acne. It's horrible, no one can argue about that.
But recently, I've been having pain in my abdomen, right side. Since I started taking Rinvoq in 2024, this pain came and went. I tried to pinpoint it, I thought it was because I ate leafy greens or legumes since the pain was often associated with gases. So I avoided these foods, and all is well. However, just this week, I experienced the pain three times, and I didn't eat anything aside from chicken and bread. (Diet is already limited due to Crohn's and allergies)
I recently did an ultrasound, and they discovered an 8mm gallbladder stone. Doctors said it's not an issue, and it is not likely the cause of pain. 
But then, I read that Rinvoq causes an increase in cholesterol and gallbladder stones are made of cholesterol. So I was thinking maybe this is a side effect of the medication???
Also, does the CRP or Calprotectin ever show high inflammatory markers while on Rinvoq?
